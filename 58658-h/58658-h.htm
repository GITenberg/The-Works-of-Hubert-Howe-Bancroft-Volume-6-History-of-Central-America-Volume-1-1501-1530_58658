<h2>
PREFACE.
</h2>

<p>
During the year 1875 I published under title of
<a href="#Native_Races"><i>The Native Races of the Pacific States</i></a> what purports
to be an exhaustive research into the character and
customs of the aboriginal inhabitants of the western
portion of North America at the time they were first
seen by their subduers. The present work is a history
of the same territory from the coming of the Europeans.
</p>

<p>
The plan is extensive and can be here but briefly explained.
The territory covered embraces the whole of
Central America and Mexico, and all Anglo-American
domains west of the Rocky Mountains. First given
is a glance at European society, particularly Spanish
civilization at about the close of the fifteenth century.
This is followed by a summary of maritime exploration
from the fourth century to the year 1540, with
some notices of the earliest American books. Then,
beginning with the discoveries of Columbus, the
men from Europe are closely followed as one after
another they find and take possession of the country
in its several parts, and the doings of their
successors are chronicled. The result is a <span class="smcap">History
of the Pacific States of North America</span>, under
the following general divisions:—<i>History of Central
America</i>;
<i>History of Mexico</i>;
<i>History of the North
Mexican States</i>;
<i>History of New Mexico and Arizona</i>;
<i>History of California</i>;
<i>History of Nevada</i>;
<i>History
of Utah</i>;
<i>History of the Northwest Coast</i>;
<i>History
of Oregon</i>;
<i>History of Washington, Idaho, and Montana</i>;
<i>History of British Columbia</i>, and <i>History of
Alaska</i>.
</p>

<p>
Broadly stated, my plan as to order of publication
proceeds geographically from south to north, as
indicated in the list above given, which for the most
part is likewise the chronological order of conquest
and occupation. In respect of detail, to some extent
I reverse this order, proceeding from the more general
to the more minute as I advance northward.
The difference, though considerable, is however less
in reality than in appearance. And the reason I hold
sufficient. To give to each of the Spanish-American
provinces, and later to each of the federal and independent
states, covering as they do with dead monotony
centuries of unchanging action and ideas, time
and space equal to that which may be well employed
in narrating north-western occupation and empire-building
would be no less impracticable than profitless.
It is my aim to present complete and accurate
histories of all the countries whose events I attempt
to chronicle, but the annals of the several Central
American and Mexican provinces and states, both
before and after the Revolution, run in grooves too
nearly parallel long to command the attention of the
general reader.
</p>

<p>
In all the territorial subdivisions, southern as well
as northern, I treat the beginnings and earliest development
more exhaustively than later events. After
the Conquest, the histories of Central America and
Mexico are presented on a scale sufficiently comprehensive,
but national rather than local. The northern
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_vii' href='#Page_vii'>vii</a></span>
Mexican states, having had a more varied experience,
arising from nearer contact with progressional
events, receive somewhat more attention in regard to
detail than other parts of the republic. To the
Pacific United States is devoted more space comparatively
than to southern regions, California being
regarded as the centre and culminating point of this
historical field.
</p>

<p class="p2">
For the <i>History of Central America</i>, to which this
must serve as special as well as general introduction,
I would say that, besides the standard chroniclers and
the many documents of late printed in Spain and elsewhere,
I have been able to secure a number of valuable
manuscripts nowhere else existing; some from the
Maximilian, Ramirez, and other collections, and all of
Mr E. G. Squier's manuscripts relating to the subject
fell into my hands. Much of the material used
by me in writing of this very interesting part of the
world has been drawn from obscure sources, from
local and unknown Spanish works, and from the
somewhat confused archives of Costa Rica, Honduras,
Nicaragua, Salvador, and Guatemala.
</p>

<p>
Material for the history of western North America
has greatly increased of late. Ancient manuscripts
of whose existence historians have never known, or
which were supposed to be forever lost, have been
brought to light and printed by patriotic men and
intelligent governments. These fragments supply
many missing links in the chain of early events, and
illuminate a multitude of otherwise obscure parts.
</p>

<p>
My efforts in gathering material have been continued,
and since the publication of <i><a href="#Native_Races">The Native Races</a></i>
fifteen thousand volumes have been added to my collection.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_viii' href='#Page_viii'>viii</a></span>
Among these additions are bound volumes
of original documents, copies from public and private
archives, and about eight hundred manuscript dictations
by men who played their part in creating the
history. Most of those who thus gave me their testimony
in person are now dead; and the narratives of
their observations and experiences, as they stand recorded
in these manuscript volumes, constitute no
unimportant element in the foundation upon which
the structure of this western history in its several
parts must forever rest.
</p>

<p class="p2">
To the experienced writer, who might otherwise
regard the completion of so vast an undertaking within
so apparently limited a period as indicative of work
superficially done, I would say that this History was
begun in 1869, six years before the publication of <i><a href="#Native_Races">The
Native Races</a></i>; and although the earlier volumes of the
several divisions I was obliged for the most part not
only to plan and write, but to extract and arrange my
own material, later I was able to utilize the labors of
others. Among these as the most faithful and efficient
I take pleasure in mentioning Mr Henry L. Oak, Mr
William Nemos, Mr Thomas Savage, Mrs Frances
Fuller Victor, and Mr Ivan Petroff, of whom, and
of others, I speak at length elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
Of my methods of working I need say but little
here, since I describe them more fully in another place.
Their peculiarity, if they have any, consists in the
employment of assistants, as before mentioned, to
bring together by indices, references, and other devices,
all existing testimony on each topic to be treated.
I thus obtain important information, which otherwise,
with but one lifetime at my disposal, would have been
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_ix' href='#Page_ix'>ix</a></span>
beyond control. Completeness of evidence by no
means insures a wise decision from an incompetent
judge; yet the wise judge gladly avails himself of all
attainable testimony. It has been my purpose to give
in every instance due credit to sources of information,
and cite freely such conclusions of other writers as
differ from my own. I am more and more convinced
of the wisdom and necessity of such a course, by which,
moreover, I aim to impart a certain bibliographic
value to my work. The detail to be encompassed appeared
absolutely unlimited, and more than once I
despaired of ever completing my task. Preparatory
investigation occupied tenfold more time than the
writing.
</p>

<p class="p2">
I deem it proper to express briefly my idea of what
history should be, and to indicate the general line of
thought that has guided me in this task. From the
mere chronicle of happenings, petty and momentous,
to the historico-philosophical essay, illustrated with
here and there a fact supporting the writer's theories,
the range is wide. Neither extreme meets the requirements
of history, however accurate the one or
brilliant the other. Not to a million minute photographs
do we look for practical information respecting
a mountain range, nor yet to an artistic painting of
some one striking feature for a correct description.
From the two extremes, equally to be avoided, the
true historian will, whatever his inclination, be impelled
by prudence, judgment, and duty from theory
toward fact, from vivid coloring toward photographic
exactness. Not that there is too much brilliancy in
current history, but too little fact. An accurate record
of events must form the foundation, and largely the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_x' href='#Page_x'>x</a></span>
superstructure. Yet events pure and simple are by
no means more important than the institutionary development
which they cause or accompany. Men,
institutions, industries, must be studied equally. A
man's character and influence no less than his actions
demand attention. Cause and effect are more essential
than mere occurrence; achievements of peace
should take precedence of warlike conquest; the condition
of the people is a more profitable and interesting
subject of investigation than the acts of governors,
the valor of generals, or the doctrines of priests.
The historian must classify, and digest, and teach as
well as record; he should not, however, confound his
conclusions with the facts on which they rest. Symmetry
of plan and execution as well as rigid condensation,
always desirable, become an absolute necessity
in a work like that which I have undertaken. In
respect to time and territory my field is immense.
The matter to be presented is an intricate complication
of annals, national and sectional, local and personal.
That my plan is in every respect the best
possible, I do not say; but it is the best that my
judgment suggests after long deliberation. The extent
of this work is chargeable to the magnitude of
the subject and the immense mass of information
gathered rather than to any tendency to verbosity.
There is scarcely a page but has been twice or thrice
rewritten with a view to condensation; and instead
of faithfully discharging this irksome duty, it would
have been far easier and cheaper to have sent a hundred
volumes through the press. The plan once
formed, I sought to make the treatment exhaustive
and symmetrical. Not all regions nor all periods are
portrayed on the same scale: but though the camera
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_xi' href='#Page_xi'>xi</a></span>
of investigation is set up before each successive topic
at varying distances, the picture, large or small, is
finished with equal care. I may add that I have attached
more than ordinary importance to the matter
of mechanical arrangement, by which through title-pages,
chapter-headings, and indices the reader may
expeditiously refer to any desired topic, and find all
that the work contains about any event, period, place,
institution, man, or book; and above all I have aimed
at exactness.
</p>

<p class="p2">
We hear much of the philosophy of history, of the
science and signification of history; but there is only
one way to write anything, which is to tell the truth,
plainly and concisely. As for the writer, I will only
say that while he should lay aside for the time his
own religion and patriotism, he should be always ready
to recognize the influence and weigh the value of the
religion and patriotism of others. The exact historian
will lend himself neither to idolatry nor to detraction,
and will positively decline to act either as
the champion or assailant of any party or power.
Friendships and enmities, loves and hates, he will
throw into the crucible of evidence to be refined and
cast into forms of unalloyed truth. He must be just
and humble. To clear judgment he must add strict
integrity and catholicity of opinion. Ever in mind
should be the occult forces that move mankind, and
the laws by which are formulated belief, conscience,
and character. The actions of men are governed by
proximate states of mind, and these are generated
both from antecedent states of mind and antecedent
states of body, influenced by social and natural environment.
The right of every generation should be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_xii' href='#Page_xii'>xii</a></span>
determined, not by the ethics of any society, sect, or
age, but by the broad, inexorable teachings of nature;
nor should he forget that standards of morality are a
freak of fashion, and that from wrongs begotten of
necessity in the womb of progress has been brought
forth right, and likewise right has engendered wrongs.
He should remember that in the worst men there is
much that is good, and in the best much that is bad;
that constructed upon the present skeleton of human
nature a perfect man would be a monster; nor should
he forget how much the world owes its bad men. But
alas! who of us are wholly free from the effects of
early training and later social atmospheres! Who
of us has not in some degree faith, hope, and charity!
Who of us does not hug some ancestral tradition, or
rock some pet theory!
</p>

<p class="p2">
As to the relative importance of early history, here
and elsewhere, it is premature for any now living to
judge. Beside the bloody battles of antiquity, the
sieges, crusades, and wild convulsions of unfolding
civilization, this transplanting of ours may seem tame.
Yet the great gathering of the enlightened from all
nations upon these shores, the subjugation of the
wilderness with its wild humanity, and the new empire-modelling
that followed, may disclose as deep a significance
in the world's future as any display of army
movements, or dainty morsels of court scandal, or the
idiosyncrasies of monarchs and ministers. It need
not be recited to possessors of our latter-day liberties
that the people are the state, and rulers the servants.
It is historical barbarism, of which the Homeric poems
and Carlovingian tales not alone are guilty, to throw
the masses into the background, or wholly to ignore
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_xiii' href='#Page_xiii'>xiii</a></span>
them. "Heureux le peuple dont l'histoire ennuie,"
is an oft repeated aphorism; as if deeds diabolical
were the only actions worthy of record. But we of
this new western development are not disposed to
exalt brute battling overmuch; as for rulers and generals,
we discover in them the creatures, not the creators,
of civilization. We would rather see how nations
originate, organize, and unfold; we would rather examine
the structure and operations of religions, society
refinements and tyrannies, class affinities and antagonisms,
wealth economies, the evolutions of arts and
industries, intellectual and moral as well as æsthetic
culture, and all domestic phenomena with their
homely joys and cares. For these last named, even
down to dress, or the lack of it, are in part the man,
and the man is the nation. With past history we may
become tolerably familiar; but present developments
are so strange, their anomalies are so startling to him
who attempts to reduce them to form, that he is well
content to leave for the moment the grosser extravagances
of antiquity, howsoever much superior in interest
they may be to the average mind. Yet in the old
and the new we may alike from the abstract to the
concrete note the genesis of history, and from the
concrete to the abstract regard the analysis of history.
The historian should be able to analyze and to generalize;
yet his path leads not alone through the enticing
fields of speculation, nor is it his only province to
pluck the fruits and flowers of philosophy, or to blow
brain bubbles and weave theorems. He must plod
along the rough highways of time and development,
and out of many entanglements bring the vital facts
of history. And therein lies the richest reward.
"Shakspere's capital discovery was this," says Edward
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_xiv' href='#Page_xiv'>xiv</a></span>
Dowden, "that the facts of the world are worthy
to command our highest ardour, our most resolute
action, our most solemn awe; and that the more we
penetrate into fact, the more will our nature be quickened,
enriched, and exalted."
</p>

<p class="p2">
That the success of this work should be proportionate
to the labor bestowed upon it is scarcely to
be expected; but I do believe that in due time it will
be generally recognized as a work worth doing, and
let me dare to hope fairly well done. If I read life's
lesson aright, truth alone is omnipotent and immortal.
Therefore, of all I wrongfully offend I crave beforehand
pardon; from those I rightfully offend I ask no
mercy; their censure is dearer to me than would be
their praise.

</p>

<p>
How stood this ever changing world four hundred
years ago? Already Asia was prematurely old. Ships
skirted Africa; but, save the northern seaboard, to all
but heaven the continent was as dark as its stolid inhabitants.
America was in swaddlings, knowing not
its own existence, and known of none. Europe was
an aged youth, bearing the world-disturbing torch
which still shed a dim, fitful light and malignant
odor.
</p>

<p>
Societies were held together by loyalty to civil and
ecclesiastical rulers; not by that coöperation which
springs from the common interests of the people.
Unhallowed were all things real; divine the unsubstantial
and potential. Beyond the stars were laid
out spiritual cities, and under foot the hollow ground
was dismal with the groans of the departed. Regions
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_2' href='#Page_2'>2</a></span>
of the world outlying the known, were tenanted by
sea-monsters, dragons, and hobgoblins. European commerce
crept forth from walled towns and battlemented
buildings, and peradventure, escaping the dangers of
the land, hugged the shore in open boats, resting by
night, and trembling amid-ships by day. Learning was
chiefly confined to the clergy. Feudalism as a system
was dead, but its evils remained. Innumerable burdens
were heaped upon the people by the dominant classes
who gave them little protection in return. Upon the
most frivolous pretexts the fruits of their industry
were seized and appropriated by their masters. It was
a praiseworthy performance for a hundred thousand
men to meet and slay each other to gratify the whim
of a state minister or a king's concubine. Then came
a change, and by reason of their revised Ptolemies,
their antipodal soundings, and new geographies, their
magnetic needles, printing machines, and men-killing
implements, learning began to revive, and the people
began in some faint degree to think for themselves.
</p>

<p>
Under the shifting sands of progress truth incubates,
and the hatched ideas fashion for themselves
a great mind in which they may find lodgment;
fashion for themselves a tongue by which to speak;
fashion for themselves a lever by which to move the
world.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">TRANSITIONAL EPOCH.</div>

<p class="p2">
The epoch of which I speak rested upon the confines
of two civilizations, the old and the new. It
was a transition period from the dim twilight of the
dark age to the brightness of modern thought; from
an age of unquestioning faith to one of curiosity and
scepticism. It was a period of concretions and crystallizations,
following one of many rarefactions; religion
was embracing science; astrology was merging
into astronomy; magic into physics; alchemy into
chemistry. Saltpetre was superseding steel in warfare;
feudalism having fulfilled its purpose was being
displaced by monarchical power; intercourse was springing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_3' href='#Page_3'>3</a></span>
up between nations, and international laws were
being made. Even the material universe and the
realms of space were enlarging with the enlargement
of mind. Two worlds were about that time unveiled
to Spain, an oriental and an occidental; by the capture
of Constantinople ancient Greek and Latin learning
was emancipated, and the Christian religion became
settled as the faith of Europe; while toward the
west, the mists of the ages lifted from the ocean, and,
as if emerging from primeval waters, a fair new continent
ripe for a thousand industries stood revealed.
</p>

<p>
This was progress indeed, and the mind, bursting
its mediæval fetters, stood forth and took a new survey.
With the dawn of the sixteenth century there
appeared a universal awakening throughout Christendom.
Slumbering civilization, roused by the heavy
tread of marching events, turned from royal prison-houses
of learning, and beheld with wonder and delight
the unfolding of these new mysteries. The dust
and cobwebs of the past, which had so long dimmed
the imagination, were disturbed by an aggressive
spirit of inquiry. The report of exploding fallacies
reverberated throughout Europe; and as the smoke
cleared away, and light broke in through the obscurity,
there fell as it were scales from the eyes of the learned,
and man gazed upon his fellow-man with new and
strange emotions. For centuries men's minds had
been chained to the traditions of the past; thought
had traveled as in a treadmill; philosophy had advanced
with the face turned backward; knight-errantry
had been the highest type of manhood, and Christianity,
like its founder, had been made to bear the sins
of the many. While its friends claimed for it all the
virtues of mankind, its enemies charged it with all
the vices. The first efforts of scholastics in their exposition
of these new appearances was to square the
accumulative information of the day with the subtleties
of the schools and the doctrines and dogmas of the
past. The source of all knowledge and the foundation
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_4' href='#Page_4'>4</a></span>
of all science were claimed to be in the holy scriptures
and in the tenets of the church. Any conception,
or invention, or discovery that might pass unscathed
these two touchstones was denominated truth, though
human reason could not grasp it. Likewise, any stray
fact which by these tests failed satisfactorily to account
for itself, was pronounced false, though human
reason declared it true.
</p>

<p>
I do not mean to say that all darkness and nescience
were swept away in a breath, or that knowledge fell
suddenly on mankind like an inspiration; it was
enough for some few to learn for the first time of
such a thing as ignorance. Although the change was
real and decisive, and the mind in its attempt to
fathom new phenomena was effectually lured from the
mystic pages of antiquity, there yet remained enough
and to spare of ignorance and credulity. Searchers
after the truth yet saw as through a glass darkly; the
clearer vision of face to face could be attained only by
slow degrees, and often the very attempt to scale the
prison-house walls plunged the aspirant after higher
culture yet deeper into the ditch; but that there were
any searchings at all was no small advance. Shackles
were stricken off, but the untutored intellect as yet
knew not the use of liberty; a new light was flashed
in upon the mental vision, but the sudden glare was
for the moment bewildering, and not until centuries
after was the significance of this transitional epoch
fully manifest. It may be possible to exaggerate the
importance of this awakening; yet how exaggerate the
value to western Europe of Greek literature and the
revival of classic learning, of the invention of printing,
or the influence for good or evil on Spain of her New
World discoveries?
</p>

<p>
Rightly to understand the condition of education
in Spain in the fifteenth century, we must remember
that mental training and not the acquisition of knowledge
was the object of education, and as the object to
be attained differed greatly from that which we are
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_5' href='#Page_5'>5</a></span>
now seeking, so the result was proportionately different.
The tendency of education in the fifteenth century
was toward a more determined reliance and
belief in authority and in revelation; the tendency of
education in the nineteenth century is toward inquiry
and scepticism. As to the comparative value of these
results there are of course many differences of opinion,
and I shall not discuss them here. We may be
sure, however, that in whatsoever direction human
mind is trained by other human mind, there is ever
present and underlying all activities inexorable progress,
an eternal unfolding into ever fairer proportions
of all that is best and noblest in mankind.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">SPANISH HISTORY.</div>

<p class="p2">
Our history dates from Spain, at the time when
Castile and Aragon were the dominant power of
Europe. Before entering upon the doings, or passing
judgment upon the character, of those whose fortunes
it is the purpose of this work to follow into the
forests of the New World, let us glance at the origin
of the Spaniards, examine the cradle of their civilization,
and see out of what conditions a people so unlike
any on the globe to-day were evolved.
</p>

<p>
Far back as tradition and theory can reach, the
Iberians, possibly of Turanian stock, followed their
rude vocations, hunting, fishing, fighting; guarded on
one side by the Pyrenees, and on the others by the
sea. Next, in an epoch to whose date no approximation
is now possible, the Celts came down on Spain,
the first wave of that Aryan sea destined to submerge
all Europe. Under the Celtiberians, the fierce and
powerful compound race now formed by the union of
Iberian and Celt, broken indeed into various tribes
but with analogous customs and tongues, Spain first
became known to the civilized world. Then came
the commercial and colonizing Phœnician and planted
a settlement at Cádiz. After them the Carthaginians
landed on the eastern shore of the Peninsula and
founded Carthago Nova, now Cartagena. The power
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_6' href='#Page_6'>6</a></span>
of the Carthaginians in Spain was broken by the
Scipios, in the second Punic war, toward the close
of the third century <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>; and yet, says Ticknor,
"they have left in the population and language of
Spain, traces which have never been wholly obliterated."
</p>

<p>
The Romans, after driving out the Carthaginians, attacked
the interior Celtiberians, who fought them hard
and long; but the latter being finally subjugated, all
Hispania, save perhaps the rugged north-west, was divided
into Roman provinces, and in them the language
and institutions of Rome were established. Forced
from their hereditary feuds by the iron hand of their
conquerors, the Celtiberians rapidly increased in wealth
and numbers, and of their prosperity the Empire was
not slow to make avail. From the fertile fields of
Spain flowed vast quantities of <i>cerealia</i> into the granary
of Rome. The gold and silver of their metal-veined
sierras the enslaved Spaniards were forced to
produce, as they in succeeding ages wrung from the
natives of the New World the same unjust service.
The introduction of Christianity, about the middle of
the third century, brought upon the adherents of this
religion the most cruel persecutions; which, however,
instead of destroying it but rooted it the more firmly.
Some say, indeed, that Saint Paul preached at Saragossa,
and planted a church there; however this may
be, it was not until the conversion of Constantine that
Christianity became the dominant religion of the
Peninsula.
</p>

<p>
The fifth century opens with the dissolution of
the empire of the Romans, for the barbarians are
upon them. Over the Pyrenees, in awful deluge,
sweep Suevi, Alani, Vandals, and Silingi. The Suevi,
in <span class="smcap">a. d.</span> 409, take possession of the north-west, now
Galicia; the Alani seize Lusitania, to-day Portugal;
and the Vandals and Silingi settle Vandalusia, or Andalusia,
the latter tribe occupying Seville. Blighted
by this barbaric whirlwind, civilization droops; the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_7' href='#Page_7'>7</a></span>
arts and sciences introduced by the Romans fall
into disgrace; the churlish conquerors will have
none of them; and the culture of ancient Greece
and Rome, turning toward its original seat, flees
the inhospitable west and takes refuge in the capital
of the eastern empire, which thereafter becomes the
depository of the wrecks of classic learning. In their
dilemma the Romanized indigenes call to their help
the less uncouth Visigoths. In 427 the Vandals pass
into Africa. Between 455 and 584 the Visigoths
conquer the Romans and subjugate the Suevi; so
that now their kingdom stretches from the bank of
the Loire to Gibraltar. Thus to the Latin is added
the Gothic element; the Latin language, corrupted
as it had become, gains upon, or rather for the most
part holds its original advantage over the Gothic
tongue, and becomes the basis of the modern Castilian,
with such grammatical simplifications as the
northern taste renders necessary.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">ADVENT OF THE MOORS.</div>

<p>
Still the great Peninsula seethes and bubbles like
a caldron over the furnace-fires of its progressional
unrest. Two centuries of contentions between states,
and between kings and nobles, aggravated by the
usual convulsions incident to elective monarchies,
suffice to bring upon them a new foe. The crescent
of Islam, resting on Mecca and threatening at once
the Bosporus and the Pillars of Hercules, flames
suddenly out at its western horn over fated Spain.
At Algeciras, near Gibraltar, in 711, in great force,
the Mauritanian Arabs, or Moors, effect a landing,
invited thither by Count Julian, commander of Andalusia,
in revenge for the violation of his daughter
by Rodrigo, last of the Gothic kings. Routing the
Visigoths in the battle of Jerez de la Frontera, in
five swift years the Saracens are masters of all save
the mountainous north-west; and penetrating Aquitania,
the kingdom of the Franks is prevented from
falling into their hands only by the decisive victory
won by Charles Martel at Tours in 732. An emirate
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_8' href='#Page_8'>8</a></span>
under the caliphate of Bagdad is established at Córdova,
and multitudes of Syrian and Egyptian Mahometans
flock to Spain. Thus pressed, to the rugged
mountains of Asturias, under Pelayo, one of their
national heroes, flee such Christians as will not submit.
There the wreck of the Visigothic kingdom
takes refuge; there stubborn patriots rally and nurse
their nationality betimes in the caves of the Pyrenees,
waiting opportunity to deliver their country from the
yoke of the hated Infidel. In 755 Abdurrahman, the
last caliph of the dynasty of Ommiades, having escaped
the massacre of Damascus, wrests Spain from
the hands of the Abbassides and founds the caliphate
of Córdova, which then formed one of the four great
divisions of the Prophet's dominions. Moorish kings
now take the place of Moorish emirs, and thus is
governed Córdova till 1238, and Granada till 1492.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the Mahometans ruled mildly and well.
The native Christians living among them kept their
religion, churches, and clergy, as well as their laws
and tribunals except in cases involving capital punishment,
or where a Mahometan was a party in the
suit. The usual consequences of race-contact followed;
over wide tracts Arabic became the common
language, and so remained even after Moslem power
had fallen. As late as the fourteenth century public
acts in many parts of Spain were written in Arabic.
As the result of this intermixture, there was the
linguistic medley called <i>lingua franca</i>, a composite
of Arabic, Gothic, Latin, Hebrew, and Gallic, with
the Romance, or corrupted Latin of Spain, united
with the Limousin, the language of the gay science
spoken in Languedoc and Provence, as a base. Out
of this came the Castilian, which after undergoing
various modifications settled into the Spanish language,
leaving it substantially in its present form,
though refined and polished by subsequent centuries
of civilization. It was not, however, until near the
reign of Alfonso X., 1252-1282, long after the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_9' href='#Page_9'>9</a></span>
Christians had emerged from the mountains and had
mingled with the reconquered indigenes, that the
Castilian became perfectly established as a written,
settled, and polite language. Nor were the consequences
of Arabic occupation confined to language;
they tinged the whole life of the nation.
</p>

<p>
The Spaniards who under Pelayo had taken refuge
in the mountains of Asturias, in 716 founded a small
government called the kingdom of Oviedo. There
the seeds of liberty, trampled by adversity, took root,
and from the patriot soil arose a nation that spread
its branches wide over the land. Gradually the
Christian kingdoms enlarged. First Galicia, then,
two hundred years later, Leon and Castile were
added to the little empire. The latter part of the
tenth century the kingdoms of Leon, Castile, and
Navarre, held the northern extremity of the Peninsula,
while all the rest was under the dominion of the
caliphate of Córdova.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE EIGHT-CENTURY WAR.</div>

<p>
And now, emerged from the mountain fastnesses
whither they had fled before this southern swarm
of turbaned Infidels, the sturdy Christians press
heavily on their foe. Inch by inch, each step counting
a century, they fight their way from the Pyrenees
back to Granada. Assuming the title of caliph,
Abdurrahman III. defeats the Christians at Zamora
on the Douro, but is in turn repulsed, in 938,
at Simancas. In vain the Mahometans call to their
aid the Almoravides of Morocco; their race upon
the Peninsula is run. As portions of the country
are wrested from them, lands are awarded to notable
Christian leaders, who at intervals pause in their
holy crusade, and fall to warring on each other;
and by these intestine brawls more Christian blood
is spilt than by all the cimiters of the Saracens.
At such times the Infidels might turn and make
the Christians an easy prey; but centuries of opulence,
and, except along their northern border, of
inaction, have sapped their strength and left them
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_10' href='#Page_10'>10</a></span>
nerveless. It is the old story alike of peoples, sects,
and individuals; discipline, begotten by necessity, engenders
strength, which fattened by luxury swells to
weakness.
</p>

<p>
The beginning of the eleventh century finds the
Christians occupying about half the Peninsula, that
is to say the kingdoms of Leon, Castile, Aragon,
Navarre, and Portugal. Leon was but another name
for the kingdom of Oviedo, or Asturias, the birthplace
of Spanish nationality. Castile—Roman, <i>castella</i>;
Arabic, <i>ardo-l-koláa</i>, land of castles, so called
from the <i>castillos</i>, or forts, built there—though
destined eventually to absorb all the kingdoms of
the Peninsula, was at first a republic, consisting
of a few small towns or fortified castles, which had
united for mutual protection from both Mahometans
and contentious Christian brethren. In 1037 Leon
was united by Ferdinand I., called the Great, to
Castile; and from its central position, and the
strength arising from perpetual vigilance, the new
kingdom gradually widened and added to its dominions,
until eventually all the kingdoms of the Peninsula
were united under the banner of Castile.
Navarre belonged to a French count, whose successor
drove the Saracens from the territory adjacent on
the south-west, and founded the kingdom of Aragon.
</p>

<p>
In 1085 the Cid, a Castilian chieftain, born at
Búrgos, and famous in poetry, romance, and war,
seized Toledo, and overran Valencia; in 1118 Alfonso
of Aragon wrested Saragossa from the Moors. Portugal,
hitherto a province of Castile, assumed the
title of kingdom in 1139. Finally the four kingdoms
of the north, together with Portugal, formed a
league against the Infidels, and in a great battle
fought in the Sierra Morena, near Tolosa, in 1212,
Mahometan power in Spain was effectually broken.
In this decisive engagement the Christian confederates
were commanded by Alfonso III. of Castile,
who never rested till the followers of the Prophet
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_11' href='#Page_11'>11</a></span>
were driven from the central plateau. To the kingdom
of Castile, Ferdinand III., 1217-1252, annexed
Jaen, Córdova, and Seville, which with difficulty were
held by his son Alfonso X., surnamed the Wise—a
better scholar than soldier, as we see. Alfonso XI.
was succeeded by Pedro el Cruel, who died in 1369.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">SPAIN'S GRANDEUR.</div>

<p>
A succession of singularly brilliant events, culminating
in the empire of Charles V., brought Spain,
at the beginning of the sixteenth century, to the
front rank among European powers. The marriage
of Ferdinand and Isabella, which in 1479 united the
crowns of Aragon and Castile; the conquest of
Granada in 1492, terminating eight centuries of almost
continuous warfare; the discovery of America
the same year; the annexation of Naples in 1503,
and of Navarre in 1512, after the union of Spain
and the Netherlands in the marriage of Juana,
daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella, with Philip the
Fair, son of the Emperor Maximilian I., and father
of Charles V., all coming in quick succession, form
a train of important incidents unparalleled in the
history of nations. Before the death of Philip II.
in 1598, the empire of Spain extended to every part
of the globe—Portugal, conquered by the duke of
Alva in 1580; Sicily and Sardinia, Artois and
Franche Comté, the Balearic and Canary islands;
in Africa—Melilla, Ceuta, Oran, and Tunis; in
Asia—the Moluccas and the Philippine Islands, together
with several settlements elsewhere; beside a
large part of the two Americas, which alone comprised
about one fifth of the world.
</p>

<p>
But nations like men must die. The full measure of
prosperity had been meted out to Spain, and now she
must lay it down—such is the inexorable law of progress.
It was the very irony of autocracy, that one
man should rule half the world! Spain's pyramid of
greatness, which assumed such lofty proportions during
the reign of their Catholic Majesties, culminated during
the reigns of their immediate successors. A long line
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_12' href='#Page_12'>12</a></span>
of ambitious and able princes had raised the empire
to a giddy height; but with an illiterate and non-progressive
populace, no sooner did the rulers become
incompetent than the nation fell in pieces. In the
height of his grandeur Spain's grandest monarch surfeited
of success and abdicated; and with the death
of his son Philip the glory of the empire departed.
Then might her epitaph be written—Nine centuries
of steady growth—a long and lusty youth, more than
falls to the lot of most nations—and in three brief
centuries more she rose, and ripened, and rotted.
</p>

<p>
It is not with death, however, but life, we have to
do. Intellectual sparks were lighting up the dark
corners of the earth, and a series of brilliant epochs
began with the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella—modern
Golden Ages they might be called. The
golden age of Spain, dating from 1474 to 1516, was
followed by Germany's golden age, which was during
the reign of Charles V., 1519-1558. Then came England
with the reign of Elizabeth, 1558-1603; then
France under Louis XIV. and Louis XV., 1640-1740;
Russia under Peter the Great, 1672-1725; and Prussia
under Frederick the Great, 1740-1786. During
this time European civilization was bursting its narrow
confines and encircling the hitherto unknown
world in every direction.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">MEASUREMENTS OF CHARACTER.</div>

<p class="p2">
The Spaniards we would know and judge. We
shall judge them, even though we know them not.
We love to judge our fellows, and to think how much
better are we than they. Little attention we give it,
though it is a self-evident proposition, that to judge a
people by any other standard than that to which they
have been taught to conform is to do them great injustice.
If we may believe psychology, thought, in
its higher phases, develops only with the development
of language; the conceptions of the mind can not
rise much higher than forms of speech will enable it
to express. Apply this postulate to the measure of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_13' href='#Page_13'>13</a></span>
character, and the corollary is, that to interpret
fairly, we must restrict our imagination to such
ideas, our mind to such beliefs, and our tongue to
such formulas as belong to those we judge. This,
however, is no easy matter. In the present age of
intellectual progress and changing activity, when old
delusions are being rapidly dispelled by science, and
new discoveries are constantly opening new channels
to distinction, it is almost impossible to place ourselves
within the narrow limits of mediæval restrictions, in
which thought and opinion were not allowed to germinate,
but were passed unchanged from one generation
to another. "It often happens," as John Stuart Mill
remarks, "that the universal belief of one age of mankind—a
belief from which no one was, nor, without an
extra effort of genius or courage, could at that time
be, free—becomes so palpable an absurdity, that the
only difficulty then is to imagine how such a thing
can ever have appeared credible." Not only were the
Church dogmas of the Middle Age accepted as truth,
but at that time to hold opinions antagonistic to established
creeds was seldom so much as deemed possible.
</p>

<p>
From the foregoing premises it clearly follows, that
rightly to measure the character of those who carried
European civilization into the wilds of America, we must,
in so far as we may, divest ourselves of the present,
and enter into the spirit of their times. We must fix
in our minds the precise epoch in the history of human
progress to which the discovery of this New World
belongs. We must roll up four brilliant centuries of
the scroll of science, cloud nine tenths of the world in
obscurity, throw a spell upon the ocean; then wall the
imagination within the confines of this narrow horizon
and conceive the effect. We must know something,
not alone of national polities and the attitude of
kings, but we must enter the society of individuals,
and study the impulses of the people. We must call
up the inscrutable past, surround ourselves with those
influences that give the stamp to character and the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_14' href='#Page_14'>14</a></span>
color to creed. We must familiarize ourselves with
scenes familiar to the people we discuss; we must
walk their streets, look through their eyes, think their
thoughts; we must personate them and practically
construe them. We should fill our breast with the
aspirations that impelled them, our imagination with
the fears that restrained them, and feel those subtle
forces which for generations had been developing intellect
and moulding opinion. We should dare even
to gain access to their domestic and religious <i>penetralia</i>,
to invade the sanctity of the hearth and altar,
to sound the hidden chords of domestic life, to walk
softly through vaulted aisles and convent corridors,
bending the ear to catch the whisperings of the confessional;
we should enter with the monk his cloister-cell,
with the gallant the presence of his lady-love,
and learn whence the significance and whither the
tendency of their strange conceits. If, at the outset,
with the political position, we also thus firmly grasp
their inner social life, much that were otherwise enigmatical
or suspicious appears in a clearer light; and
we can then behold their chivalrous but cruel deeds
with the same charity in which we hope posterity
may shroud our own enormities. Thus only may we
be led to understand the various processes by which
this phase of civilization was evolved.

<p class="p2">
The configuration and climate of the Peninsula
assist in giving variety to the character of its inhabitants.
The interior is one vast table-land, higher than
any other plateau in Europe, being from two to three
thousand feet above the level of the sea. On either
side precipitous mountain ranges interpose between
the table-land and the shores, and through these
numerous streams thread their way. The table-land
is for the most part dry and treeless, hot in summer
and cold in winter; Asturias is wet and wooded;
the valleys of the Guadalquivir, Douro, Ebro, Tagus,
and other rivers, are in places quite fertile. In the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_15' href='#Page_15'>15</a></span>
southern provinces of Andalusia and Murcia, autumn
and winter are mild and pleasant, and spring is surpassingly
lovely; but the <i>solano</i> which during summer
blows from the heated plains of Africa is intolerable to
any but the acclimated. From the snow-clad Pyrenees
the piercing blasts of winter sweep over Leon, Castile,
and Estremadura, at the north protracting the long
winter and making cold and humid the spring, and
arrive at the middle provinces stripped of their moisture,
but not of their raw unwelcome chilliness.
</p>

<p class="p2">
During the eleven convulsive centuries preceding
our epoch we have seen mix and agglutinate the several
ingredients of Spanish character—Iberian, Celt,
Phœnician; Roman, Goth, and Moor, all contributing
their quota. Christian, Infidel, and Jew, with
their loves and hates, season the mass; and thus society
becomes an <i>olla podrida</i>, and Spain presents the
anomalous race of the world.
</p>

<p>
In different provinces different race-elements preponderate,
that of Rome tincturing the whole more
strongly than any other. Under analysis these several
social ingredients may be easily detected. By
comparison with Strabo, Arnold traces many of the
social characteristics of the Spaniards back to the
Iberians. "The grave dress, the temperance and sobriety,
the unyielding spirit, the extreme indolence,
the perverseness in guerilla warfare, and the remarkable
absence of the highest military qualities ascribed
by the Greek and Roman writers," he affirms, "are
all more or less characteristic of the Spaniards of
modern times. The courtesy and gallantry of the
Spaniard to women has also come down to him from
his Iberian ancestors."
</p>

<p>
So in the volatile, dark-haired Celt, where reckless
courage and indifference to human life reached their
height, where quick perception and ready wit supplied
the place of sober thought and logical deductions,
where man was courageous and changeable, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_16' href='#Page_16'>16</a></span>
woman was at once fickle, chaste, and passionate—in
these fierce barbarians we see a multitude of traits
handed by them to their descendants. Of Phœnician
and Iberian influence, traces are seen in their skill in
scientific mining; of Gothic, in their comparatively
liberal forms of government, their attachment to
military display, and in their good faith, integrity,
and morality—would these latter had been a trifle
more Gothic; of Roman, in their love of ecclesiastical
forms, church and state loyalty, in their stately
dignity and sobriety of deportment; of Arab, in their
hatred of work, their love of freedom, their religious
enthusiasm, their tactics in war, and in their
language, poetry, art, and architecture. Some of these
terms appear paradoxical, but human nature, in its
ingredients, is ever paradoxical. In the Spanish language
Brace discovers that the principal "terms for
agriculture and science are Latin; for the Church,
Latin or Greek; for arms, riding, and war, Teutonic;
and for arts and plants in southern Spain, Arabic."
From the north and east and south the boldest of the
nations had congregated on this frontier peninsula,
waiting the outburst which, after a thousand years
of fermentation, broke over its western slope.
</p>

<p>
Buckle, in support of a theory referring the origin
of character to physical causes, ascribes the superstition
of Spain to famine and disease, to earthquakes
and the awe-producing phenomena of wild scenery;
their fickleness he attributes to climate, the heat and
dryness in Spain interrupting labor and leading to desultory
habits; their love of romance and adventure
he traces to pastoral life, which prevailed to the
neglect of agriculture during the Moorish invasion.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">EVOLUTION OF THE SPANISH NATION.</div>

<p>
The fall of Granada left the Peninsula occupied
essentially as follows: In the north and west were
the descendants of Goths and Celts who, unmolested
by Roman or Moor, retained in a measure their ancestral
characteristics. Low of stature, thick-set and
awkward, as strong and as hairy almost as bears, the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_17' href='#Page_17'>17</a></span>
men of Asturias and Galicia, of Leon and Biscay,
century after century come and go, living as their
fathers lived, neither better nor worse, caring nothing
for Arab or Dutchman, and little even for the Spanish
kings; proud as ever of Pelayo, of the mountains
that cradled Spanish liberty, of their great antiquity,
which they boast as greater than that of any living
nation; superstitious, irritable, and impetuous, but
honest, frank, and sincere; implacable as enemies, but
faithful as friends. Their boast is that never have
they been subdued by Moor. Their chiefs were of
the ancient Gothic blood, blue blood they called it,
not being tainted with Arabic like that of their
darker southern neighbors; of such material were
early founded the kingdoms of Leon and Castile.
</p>

<p>
On their eastern side was the kingdom of Navarre,
founded by the counts of the French marches.
Though at one time these two sections had been
united, the usual partition of heritage had soon dismembered
them. Portugal, an offshoot of Castile,
was permanently separated; Aragon, founded by
Navarre, became also independent. Upon the eastern
seaboard the people of Catalonia and Valencia,
though diluted with the Limousin element, yet retain
traces of their foreign relationships. "Of the modern
evidences of race in the different provinces," says
Brace, "travellers tell us that in Valencia the people
resemble both their Keltiberian and Carthaginian
ancestors, being cunning, perfidious, vindictive, and
sullen. The burning sun has tanned their skin dark
and aided to form in them an excitable and nervous
temperament; they have, too, the superstitious tendencies
that characterize the people of a hot climate.
The Valencian women are fairer than the men, and
are conspicuous for their beauty of form. They wear
the hair and the ornaments of the head after the old
Romish style. The Catalan is rude, active and industrious,
a good soldier, and fond of his independence,
resembling both Kelts and Iberians in his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_18' href='#Page_18'>18</a></span>
covetous, bold, cruel, and warlike character. The
Aragonese are two children of the Goths in their
force of will, their attachment to constitutional liberties,
and their opposition to arbitrary power."
</p>

<p>
The tall, tough, agile eastern mountaineer presents
as marked a contrast to the stubby Asturian as does
the sparkling Andalusian to the grave Castilian. For
a long time the people of Andalusia were semi-Moorish
in their character. There, where the soft air of Africa
comes fresh from the Mediterranean, had dwelt the
dusky, graceful Arab; worshipping Mahomet as the
Castilian worshipped Christ, and regarding his Christian
and Jewish neighbors with as little affection as
either Jew or Christian regarded him. Scattered
along the banks of the Guadalquivir, and in separate
quarters of many towns of southern Spain, were bands
of that anomalous race, the gypsies. Short, dark,
ugly, with long, coarse, wavy hair, mixing with other
men as light and darkness mix, they plied their trade
of buying, stealing, and selling. During the latter
part of the war they occupied themselves in bringing
horses from Africa and selling them to Moors or
Christians.
</p>

<p>
In the mountain fastnesses of Toledo there yet
lived a remnant of Silingi stock, known as <i>almogávares</i>,
who had never bent knee to Infidel; who,
throughout the long contest which waged on every
side of them, had kept green their liberty and their
faith—a Christian oasis in the broad pagan desert.
There, too, a broken band of the chosen Israel, now
fairly launched upon their eternal wanderings, found
a momentary resting-place. Before the arrival of the
Visigoths, it is said, a colony of Hebrews planted
themselves near Toledo, and by their industry and
superior financial ability, became at length the royal
bankers, and notwithstanding bitter prejudices, they
rose high in influence, even to the honor of having
their daughters enrolled among the king's mistresses.
</p>

<p>
Thus for a time the several parts of the Peninsula
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_19' href='#Page_19'>19</a></span>
differ widely in language, manners, and institutions;
but at length, by wars and political combinations,
race-barriers are broken down, and opposing clanships
welded by an intenser hatred for some common
enemy. The south through its Mediterranean trade
soonest attains eminence, but warlike Castile subsequently
acquires predominance. Meanwhile the
masses retain their old ways better than their leaders.
The nobility, and frequenters of courts, mingling more
with the world, adopt the fashions of courts, and
change with their changes. The inhabitants of the
border provinces feel the influences of the war comparatively
little; upon the great central plateau, however,
there meet and mix almost all the stocks and
creeds of the then known world. Aryan and Semite;
Roman, Goth, and Mauritanian; Mahometan,
Christian, and Jew; planting and plucking, building
up and tearing down, fattening and starving, fighting
and worshipping and burning—the whole table-land
of Spain turned into a battle-arena of the nations,
into a world's gladiatorial show; its occupants alternately
marrying and battling, Moslem with Christian,
Moslem with Moslem, Christian with Christian,
Christian and Moslem uniting now against Christian
and now against Moslem, while the slaughter of
Jew, heretic, and gypsy fills the interlude. So pass
centuries; and from this alembic of nations is distilled
the tall, symmetrical, black-haired, bright-eyed, sharp-featured
Castilian and Estremaduran.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">RESULTS OF INTERMIXTURES.</div>

<p class="p2">
Out of this heterogeneous medley of opposing
qualities we have now to draw general characteristics.
</p>

<p>
In demeanor the Spaniard is grave, punctilious,
reserved with strangers, jealous of familiarity or encroachment
on his dignity; but among his acquaintances,
or with those who are ready to recognize what
he conceives to be his due, he throws off restraint,
and becomes an agreeable companion and a firm
friend. While impatient and resentful of fancied
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_20' href='#Page_20'>20</a></span>
slights, he is easily won by kindness, and is always
dazzled by skill in arms and personal valor.
</p>

<p>
In disposition he is serious almost to melancholy,
firm to stubbornness, imperturbable, lethargic, inert,
moody; yet when roused there breaks forth the
deepest enthusiasm and the most ungovernable
passion. So punctilious is his sense of honor, so
zealous and truthful is he in his friendships, so affectionate
and humane in all his private relations, that at
one time the term Spanish gentleman was synonymous
with everything just, generous, and high-minded
throughout Europe. In intellect he is contemplative
rather than profound, apt in emergencies, but lacking
breadth and depth. In habits he is temperate and
frugal, easily satisfied, indolent. To live without
work is his ideal of enjoyment. Dissoluteness and
intemperance can not be ranked among his vices, nor
do travellers place hospitality in his list of virtues.
There is no such word as rowdy in his vocabulary.
Turbulent from imposition he may be, and after
injury vengeful; but brawler, disturber of peace and
social order, he is not. Though taciturn, he is deep
in feeling; in his love of country he is provincial
rather than national. Though hard to be driven he
is easily led; acting collectively, officially, he is given
to venality, when personally thrown upon his honor
he is scrupulous and trusty.
</p>

<p>
In manners the Spaniard is proverbial for high
breeding, courtesy, and decorum. Whether beggar
or courtier, his politeness seldom deserts him. "Dios
guarde á usted," May God protect you; "Vaya usted
con Dios, caballero," God be with you, sir; are the
usual valedictions. In reply to the importunities
of a beggar the cavalier exclaims, "Perdone usted,
por Dios, hermano," For the love of God excuse me,
my brother. To the highest noble and to the meanest
peasant the greeting is the same. Sedate, sober-minded,
reserved, the Spaniard is but the modified
result of his several exemplars. "All Spaniards,"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_21' href='#Page_21'>21</a></span>
remarks Ford, "are prodigal to each other in cheap
names and titles of honor; thus even beggars address
each other as <i>señor y caballero</i>, lord and knight.
The most coveted style is <i>excelencia</i>, your excellency."
Nicknames are common. No one rises to
distinction without carrying with him one or more
appellations significant of the skill or occupation of
his early days.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">CASTILIAN PRIDE AND POLITENESS.</div>

<p>
The Castilian has less ingenuity in mechanics, less
skill in trade, less taste, less delicacy of perception,
than the Italian, but far more pride, firmness, and
courage; a more solemn demeanor, and a stronger
sense of honor.
</p>

<p>
Every Spaniard of whatever class considers himself
a <i>caballero</i>, a well-born and Christian gentleman, the
superior of most, the equal of any, the inferior of
none. Profuse in proffers of kindness, he is no less
slow to fulfil them than to accept favors from others.
He is very vain; vain of personal appearance, vain of
his ancestry, his breeding; vain of his ignorance and
superstition; proud of many things he should be
ashamed of, and ashamed of nothing. Thieving was
never prominent as a national vice. As a rule Spaniards
are too proud to steal; the impulse of wounded
affection or injured pride nerves the arm that strikes,
oftener than the desire for plunder.
</p>

<p>
The old German cosmographer Sebastian Munster
quaintly writes, Basel, 1553: "The Spaniards have
good heads, but with all their studying they learn
but little, for after having half learned a thing they
think themselves very wise, and in their talk try to
show much learning which they do not possess."
Comparing them with the French, the same chronicler
says: "The Frenchmen are taller, but the Spaniards
more hardy. In war, the Spaniards are deliberate,
and the French, impetuous. The French are
great babblers, but the Spaniards can well keep a
secret. The French are joyous and light of thought;
they like to live well; but the Spaniards are melancholy,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_22' href='#Page_22'>22</a></span>
serious, and not given to carousing. The
French receive their guests friendlily and treat them
well, but the Spaniards are cross to strangers, so that
one must go from house to house in search of entertainment.
The cause of this is that Spaniards have
travelled little, and do not like to spend their money
for food."
</p>

<p>
In Castile, more than elsewhere, was seen the
perfect central type, which in its earlier stages
was so remarkable for practical sagacity, for an insight
into causes and motives, and skill in the adaptation
of means to ends. In the wars of the New
World, affirms Macaulay, "where something different
from ordinary strategy was required in the general,
and something different from ordinary discipline of
the soldier, where it was every day necessary to meet
by some new expedient the varying tactics of a barbarous
enemy, the Spanish adventurers, sprung from
the common people, displayed a fertility of resource,
and a talent for negotiation and command, to which
history scarcely affords a parallel." It must be borne
in mind, however, that the New World adventurer
was not always a national type.
</p>

<p>
Graham declares that "the history of the expeditions
which terminated in the conquest of Mexico
and Peru displays, perhaps, more strikingly than any
other portion of the records of the human race, what
amazing exertions the spirit of man can prompt him to
attempt, and sustain him to endure." And again—"The
masses," says Ford, who has studied them well,
"the least spoilt and the most national, stand like pillars
amid ruins, and on them the edifice of Spain's
greatness must be reconstructed." "All the force of
Europe," exclaims Peterborough, "would not be sufficient
to subdue the Castiles with the people against it."
</p>

<div class="sidenote">REVERENCE FOR ANTIQUITY.</div>

<p>
So great is their reverence for antiquity, that they
appear to live almost as much in the past as in the
present. Age is synonymous with wisdom; the older
the habit or opinion, the more worthy of belief it is.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_23' href='#Page_23'>23</a></span>
Innovation they abhor as dangerous; the universe of
knowledge stands already revealed; there is nothing
more to learn. Their premises they know to be
sound, their conclusions correct, their beliefs true;
what necessity then for further troubling themselves?
Children in everything but teachableness, with themselves
and their traditions they are content. Their
education is finished. This is the most hopeless form
of ignorance. Their legends they carefully preserve,
old-time customs they love to practise, and they dwell
with devoted enthusiasm on the exploits of their ancestors.
To this day, twelve centuries after the
occurrence, the peasantry of Asturias are divided between
the descendants of those who aided the patriot
Pelayo against the Moors, and those who did not—the
latter being stigmatized as <i>vaqueros</i>; while the Andalusian
Morisco keeps alive the story of Granada's
grandeur, and dreams of Moslem warriors, of Abencerrage
knights, and the restoration of former greatness.
So strong is the influence of tradition and dead
ancestry.
</p>

<p>
Speaking of the quality of firmness, and tenacity of
purpose, says Bell, "So obstinate is the Spaniard, and
in some provinces so remarkably self-willed, that the
inhabitants of one part of Spain make a jest of the
others on that account. Thus the obstinate Biscayan
is represented as driving a nail into the wall with his
head, whilst the still more obstinate Aragonian is figured
in the same act and attitude, but with the point
of the nail turned outward!" With the poniard at
his throat, many a prostrate foe will die rather than
yield, and as surely will the victor plunge in the fatal
weapon if the cry for quarter be not quickly uttered.
In Andalusia there was a fashion prevalent among
duellists, when determined to fight their quarrel to the
end, of firmly binding together, below the elbows, the
left arms of the combatants; then, with knives in
their right hands, they fought until one or both were
dead.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_24' href='#Page_24'>24</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding their excessive loyalty to their
rulers, their love of antiquity and hatred of change;
and notwithstanding the oppression of their princes,
the condition of the lower classes in Spain at the
close of the fifteenth century was far above that of
the same class in any other European country. This
was owing, not to any special consideration on the
part of their political or ecclesiastical rulers, but to
that greatest of scourges, war.
</p>

<p>
While the rulers were absorbed in conquering, and
in keeping themselves from being conquered, except
within the immediate battle-arena the people were
left much alone. Besides, armies must have supplies,
and producers were held in esteem by the military
consumers.
</p>

<p>
Inequalities of power and wealth, unless arrested
by extrinsic causes, ever tend to wider extremes. In
Spain, the increase of wealth in the hands of priests
and princes was checked by long-continued war. The
products of the country must be used to feed the
soldiery, and the power of the nobility must be
employed against the common enemy. There was
neither the time nor the opportunity to grind the
people to the uttermost. Though the war bore
heavily upon the working classes, it proved to them
the greatest blessing; while the masses elsewhere
throughout Europe were kept in a state of feudalistic
serfdom, the necessity of Spain being for men rather
than for beasts, elevation followed. Further than
this, race-contact, and the friction attending the interminglings
of courts and camps, tended in some
degree towards polishing and refining society. "Since
nothing makes us forget the arbitrary distinctions of
rank," says Hallam, "so much as participation in any
common calamity, every man who had escaped the
great shipwreck of liberty and religion in the mountains
of Asturias was invested with a personal dignity,
which gave him value in his own eyes and those of
his country. It is probably this sentiment transmitted
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_25' href='#Page_25'>25</a></span>
to posterity, and gradually fixing the national
character, that had produced the elevation of manner
remarked by travellers in the Castilian peasant."
</p>

<div class="sidenote">CASTE AND SOCIAL STRATA.</div>

<p>
And yet there were caste and social stratification
enough. The stubborn manliness of the lower orders
did not make them noble. Royalty alone was divine.
The nobles loved money, yet for them to traffic was
disgraceful. The ecclesiastic, whose calling placed him
on a plane distinct from these, aside from his religious
teachings, stood out as the earnest advocate of honest
labor. Work was well enough for Moor, and Jew,
and Indian; but he whose line of fighting ancestors
had not beginning within the memory of man, must
starve rather than stain his lineage by doing something
useful.
</p>

<p>
The several social strata, moreover, were jealously
kept distinct. The first distinction was that which
separated them from foreigners. In the days of Cæsar
and Cicero, Rome was master of the world; Rome
was the world; were any not of Rome they were
barbarians. So it was with Spaniards. To be of
Castile was to be the most highly favored of mortals;
to be a Spaniard, though not a Castilian, was something
to be proud of; to be anything else was most
unfortunate.
</p>

<p>
The next distinction was between the Spaniard of
pure blood and the Christianized native of foreign
origin. In the eyes of the Castilian baptism could
not wholly cleanse a Moor or Jew. Moriscos the
Church might make; heretics the Inquisition might
reconstruct; but all Spain could not make from
foreign material a Christian Spaniard of the pure
ancient blood. About foreign fashions, foreign inventions,
foreign progress, foreign criticism, they
cared nothing. And probably nowhere in modern
times was this irrational idea of caste carried to
such an absurd extent as in the New World. Children
of Spanish parentage, born in America, were
regarded socially as inferior to children of the same
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_26' href='#Page_26'>26</a></span>
parents who happened to be born in Spain. To be
born a Spanish peasant was better than <i>hidalgo</i>, or
cavalier, with American nativity; for at one time the
former, on migrating to America, was entitled by
virtue of that fact to the prefix 'Don.' Under the
viceroys native Mexicans, though of pure Castilian ancestry,
were too often excluded from the higher offices
of Church and State; and this notwithstanding that
both canonical and civil law, if we may believe Betancur
y Figueroa, provided that natives should be
preferred in all ecclesiastical appointments from the
lightest benefice to the highest prelacy. "But notwithstanding
such repeated recommendations," says
Robertson, "preferment in almost every different line
is conferred on native Spaniards." Mr Ward, English
consul at Mexico in 1825-7, affirms that "the
son, who had the misfortune to be born of a creole
mother, was considered as an inferior, in the house
of his own father, to the European book-keeper or
clerk, for whom the daughter, if there were one, and
a large share of the fortune were reserved. 'Eres
criollo y basta;' You are a creole and that is enough,
was a common phrase amongst the Spaniards when
angry with their children." Truly it was a good
thing in those days to be at once 'of Christ' and
'of Spain.' It was positively believed by some that
blood flowed in accordance with the majesty of law,
and that the quality of one was inferior to the quality
of another. The blood of the Indian was held as
scarcely more human than the blood of beasts, and
was often shed as freely.
</p>

<p>
Then, too, there was a distinction between the profession
of arms and all other professions. Following
republican Rome again, the education of no man
aspiring to a public career was complete until he had
served as a soldier. No one can truthfully charge
the Spaniards of the sixteenth century with lack of
courage. Military skill was the highest type of manhood.
Of danger they made a plaything, not only
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_27' href='#Page_27'>27</a></span>
in their wars but in their sports. Life was dull
unless brightened by blood.
</p>

<p>
In Aragon the barons were limited to a few great
families who traced their descent from twelve peers,
called <i>ricos homes de natura</i>. Although obliged to
attend the king in his wars, in every other respect
they were independent. They were themselves exempt
from taxation and punishment, and held absolute
authority over the lives and property of their
vassals. The next lower order of nobility in Aragon
was called <i>infanzones</i>, corresponding to the hidalgos
of Castile. The <i>caballeros</i>, or knights, were the immediate
followers of the <i>ricos homes</i>, and were possessed
of important privileges.
</p>

<p>
In La Mancha the peasantry were of a quality
different from those sent by Castile and Estremadura
to the New World. Quintana writes of them, "He
who travels through La Mancha will see the scaffold
before he sees the town. They are lazy, dirty, quarrelsome,
and never suffer from hunger, for when they
wish to become the owners of anything they take it;"
and remarks another, "They live on parched <i>garbanzos</i>,
and pass the winter lying on their bellies like
reptiles in the sun." See Murillo's matchless pictures.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">JEWS AND MOORS.</div>

<p>
Another class and race, broken fragments of which
we have before encountered, secured more rest in
Spain than elsewhere, yet from a different cause.
Homeless Israel in the Arab found a friend. Not
that the Mahometans loved the Jews, but because
the Christians hated them, was their condition made
so tolerable in Spain under Saracen rule. Then,
and until their expulsion, they occupied an important
position, being the chief money-handlers, merchants,
and bankers. Overcome in their dislike for each
other by a more bitter hatred against their common
enemy, the Jews and Moors lived upon terms somewhat
approaching equality. The Jews surpassed their
Moorish masters in wealth, and were but little inferior
to them in arts and letters. They were not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_28' href='#Page_28'>28</a></span>
only usurers, but husbandmen, artisans, and doctors.
As Christian domination extended southward, this
comparatively happy state of the Spanish Jews disappeared.
Under pretext of justice, their moneys
were wrested from them by the nobles; indeed, if too
stubborn they were not unfrequently put to death;
and with the capitulation of Granada and the loss of
their Moorish allies, the condition of the Jews became
pitiable in the extreme. Two incidents of the crowning
of Pope John XXIII., in 1410, as related by
Monstrelet, give us a tolerably fair idea of the feelings
entertained toward the Jews. In his progress
through Rome, these people presented him with a
manuscript copy of the old Testament. He, "having
examined it a little, threw it behind him, saying,
'Your religion is good, but this of ours is better.'"
And again, "There were before and behind him two
hundred men-at-arms, each having in his hand a
leathern mallet, with which they struck the Jews in
such wise as it was a pleasure to see."
</p>

<p>
With such an example the condition of the Jews
grew more serious. As for the Spaniards, they bettered
the instruction, as was sufficiently proved by
their expulsion-edict of March, 1492—an edict forbidding
unbaptized Jews to be found within the limits
of Spain at the end of four months; an edict allowing
them in that time to sell their property, but forbidding
them at the end of that time "to carry away
with them any gold, silver, or money whatsoever;"
"an edict," says the Catholic historian, Lafuente, "that
condemned to expatriation, to misery, to despair, and
to death, many thousands of families born and bred
in Spain."
</p>

<p>
In almost every mediæval town there was a Jewish
district, in which, says M. Depping, their historian,
"Jews like troops of lepers were thrust away and
huddled together into the most uncomfortable and
most unhealthy quarters of the city, as miserable as
it was disgusting;" or, as Paul Lacroix describes it,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_29' href='#Page_29'>29</a></span>
"a large enclosure of wretched houses, irregularly
built, divided by small streets with no attempt at
uniformity. The principal thoroughfare is lined with
stalls, in which are sold not only old clothes, furniture,
and utensils, but also new and glittering articles."
Within their prescribed limits, all their necessities
were supplied, and a dirt-begrimed prison-like synagogue
usually occupied the center. But even in these
wretched places they were often subjected to cruelties
the most severe and sickening. Terrible as were the
indignities heaped upon this unfortunate people it
must not be supposed that they were wholly unprovoked,
or that all the forbearance was on the part of
the sufferers. Opinions on these questions are widely
divergent, and I refer to them here only to show
more clearly the condition of Europe at the time of
which I write.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CHARGE OF CRUELTY.</div>

<p class="p2">
The Spaniards of the sixteenth century have been
called a cruel people; and so they were. Yet they
were no more cruel than other nations of their day,
and no more cruel relatively, according to the progress
of humanity, than are we to-day. Time evolves in
many respects a more refined civilization, but the
nature of man changes not. Individuals may be less
beastly; society may be regulated more by law and less
by passion; between nations in their wars and diplomacy
there may be less systematic torture, less unblushing
chicanery; but the world has yet to find a weightier
right than might. I fail to discover in America, by
Catholic Spaniards or heathen savages, deeds more
atrocious than some committed in India and China
within the century by Protestant England, the world's
model of piety and propriety; and yet the treatment
of Indians in North America by the people of Great
Britain has been far more just and humane than their
treatment by the people of the United States.
</p>

<p>
Before such a charge as that of excessive cruelty
can be made good against a people, there are several
things to be considered. And first the motive. The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_30' href='#Page_30'>30</a></span>
surgeon who amputates a limb to save a life is not
called cruel. Now the Spaniards were the spiritual
surgeons of their day. Nine tenths of all their cruelties
were committed under the conviction that what
they did was in the line of duty, and that to refrain
from so doing would have been no kindness. Though
with the experience of the past and by the clearer
light of the nineteenth century we conclude that
these convictions were false, and though we contemplate
them with horror and condemn the acts which
resulted from them as barbarous, yet it is almost
superfluous to say that with their teachings and surroundings
we should have been the same. The inherent
qualities of human nature seem to be changed
but little if at all by the cultivation and development
of mind. Secondly, the quality of cruelty is not pronounced,
but relative. There are cruelties of the heart,
of the sensibilities, no less cruel than bodily tortures.
The age of savagism is always cruel. Cruelty springs
from ignorance rather than from instinct. Childlike
and thoughtless things, things tender by instinct, are
cruel from disingenuous perversity. A clouded, unreasoning,
unreasonable mind, even when hiding
beneath it a tender heart, begets cruelty; while a
sterner disposition, if accompanied by a clear, truth-loving
intellect, delights in no injustice—and cruelty
is always unjust. This is why, if it be true as has
been charged, that notwithstanding boys are more
cruel than girls, women are more cruel than men.
Children, women, and savages are cruel from thoughtlessness;
though the cruel boy may be very tender of
his puppy, the cruel woman of her child, the cruel
savage of his horse. Even the moralities and intellectual
refinements of that day were not free from
what would seem to us studied and unnecessary
cruelty. I will cite a few instances of European
cruelty, not confined to Spaniards, which will show
not only that Spain was not more cruel than other
nations, but that the savages of America were not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_31' href='#Page_31'>31</a></span>
more cruel than the Europeans of their day. Both
tortured to the uttermost where they hated, even as
men do now; the chief difference was, the Europeans,
being the stronger, could torture the harder. Civilization
changes, not the quantity of cruelty, but the
quality only.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BARBARISMS OF EUROPE.</div>

<p>
"Cæsar Borgia," writes Sebastiano de Branca in his
diary, about the year 1500, "Cæsar Borgia was the
cruelest man of any age." To serve his purposes he
did not hesitate to use poison and perjury. He was
treacherous, incestuous, murderous, even keeping a
private executioner, Michilotto, to do his bidding.
Louis XI. of France, and other princes, kept a court
assassin. The fifteenth century was lurid with atrocities.
Rodrigo Lenzuoli, the father, Lucretia, the
daughter, and Cæsar, the son, comprised the Borgia
trio, distinguished no less for their intellect, beauty,
wealth, and bravery, than for their craft, lust, treachery,
and cruelty. Says Lecky: "Philip II. and Isabella
the Catholic inflicted more suffering in obedience to
their consciences than Nero or Domitian in obedience
to their lusts."
</p>

<p>
In 1415 John Huss was burned for his religion,
and in 1431 Joan of Arc for her patriotism. In like
manner perished thousands of others. Mahomet II.,
disputing with the Venetian artist Gentile Bellini
as to the length of John the Baptist's neck after decollation,
called a slave, and striking off his head with
one blow of his cimeter, exclaimed: "There! did
not I say yours is too long?"
</p>

<p>
Princes made bloodshed a pastime. Edward IV.
put to death a tradesman for perpetrating a pun;
caused a gentleman to be executed for speaking
against a favorite; and condemned his own brother
to death in a fit of petulance. In an interview between
this same Edward of England and the king of
France, the monarchs were brought together in huge
iron cages, each distrustful of the other. Louis XII.
confined Ludovico Sforza, duke of Milan, in an iron
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_32' href='#Page_32'>32</a></span>
cage for ten years, and until his death. This was a
punishment common at that time in Italy and Spain.
Pedro el Cruel is charged by Hallam with having
murdered his wife and mother, most of his brothers
and sisters, many of the Castilian nobility, and multitudes
of the commonalty.
</p>

<p>
The church tolerated the persecution of its enemies,
believing it was for the glory of God. Nor was this
idea confined to Spain or to the fifteenth century, for
we find in England and even in America that persecutions
for conscience' sake, with all the cruelties that
refined civilization could devise existed at the opening
of the present century; nor indeed is the world yet
completely emancipated from this thraldom.
</p>

<p>
Yet the Spaniards, I say, were bad enough. The
cruelties following the capitulation of Málaga, in 1487,
were more befitting fiends than a man and woman who
prided themselves in the title of Catholic king and
queen.
</p>

<p>
Since the establishment of the Inquisition, religious
persecutions had become but too gratifying to
the national taste. On this occasion at Málaga, the
apostate Moors were first caught and burned. Twelve
apostate Christians were then fastened to stakes in
an open place and made the barbarous sport of Spanish
cavaliers, who, mounted on fleet horses, hurled
at their naked bodies pointed reeds while rushing
past at full speed. This was continued until the torn
and bleeding flesh of their victims was filled with
darts, and the wretched sufferers expired under the
most excruciating torments. Then, of the rest of the
Moorish prisoners, three divisions were made; one
for the redemption of Christian captives, one to be
distributed among the victors as slaves, and one to
be publicly sold into slavery.
</p>

<p>
Spanish knights returned from their incursions
against the Moors with strings of turbaned heads
hanging from their saddle-bows, which, as they passed
along, they threw to the boys in the streets, in order
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_33' href='#Page_33'>33</a></span>
to inspire their youthful minds with hatred to the
foes of their religion.
</p>

<p>
From making slaves of prisoners of war, a traffic in
human flesh springs up. A slave-trade association was
formed in Portugal in 1443. Gonzalez brought slaves
to Seville; Columbus sent to Spain a cargo of Indian
slaves in 1495; in 1503 the enslavement of American
Indians was authorized by Ferdinand and Isabella; and
in 1508 the African slave-trade unfolded in all its hideous
barbarity. The slave-trade, however, was tolerated
by these sovereigns from mistaken kindness,
rather than from cruelty. It was to shield the
Indian, who died under the infliction of labor, that
Isabella permitted the importation of Africans into
the colonies.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">CIVILIZED TORTURES.</div>

<p>
Cruelty was a prominent wheel in the machinery
of government, as well as in religious discipline.
Torture was deemed inseparable from justice, either
as preparatory to trial to elicit a confession of guilt,
or as part of an execution to increase the punishment.
Hippolite de Marsilli, a learned jurisconsult of Bologna,
mentioned fourteen ways of inflicting torture,
which are given by Lacroix. Among them were
compressing the limbs with instruments or cords; the
injection of water, vinegar, or oil; application of hot
pitch; starvation; placing hot eggs under the armpits;
introducing dice under the skin; tying lighted
candles to the fingers which were consumed with the
wax, and dropping water from a great height upon
the stomach. Josse Damhoudere mentioned thirteen
modes of execution or punishment—fire, the sword,
mechanical force, quartering, the wheel, the fork, the
gibbet, dragging, spiking, cutting off the ears, dismembering,
hogging, and the pillory. Every country
had its peculiar system of torture.
</p>

<p>
In 1547 English vagrants were branded with a V
and enslaved for two years. Should the unfortunate
attempt escape, a hot S was burned into the flesh
and he was a slave for life. A second attempted
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_34' href='#Page_34'>34</a></span>
escape was death. In those days wife-whipping was
a common and respectable domestic discipline; culprits
in the pillory and stocks were stationed in the marketplace
where all the people might strike them; prisoners
were stripped of their clothes, confined in filthy
dungeons half filled with stagnant water, and there
not unfrequently left to starve, while slimy reptiles
crawled over the naked body, or drove their poisonous
fangs into the quivering flesh.
</p>

<p>
The sports of the Spaniards we now regard as
cruel, as ours will be regarded four hundred years
hence. Although delighting in games, in pantomimic
dance, in fencing, wrestling, running, leaping, hunting,
hawking, with the gentler pastime of song and guitar,
the more popular amusements were cock-fights, dog
and bull fights, bull and bear fights, bear and dog
fights, enjoyed alike by high and low, by women,
boys, and men, by laity and clergy. Sometimes
fighters would enter the arena blindfolded and engage
in deadly encounter. Yet how much more cruel
were these sports than modern horse-racing, cock-fighting,
dog-fighting, prize-fighting, rope-walking,
lion-taming, steeple-chases, to say nothing of the
more gentlemanly cruelty of raising foxes to be
hunted, and worried, and finally torn in pieces by
dogs, let posterity judge. I do not say that the sixteenth-century
sports of Spain were not more cruel
than the English sports of to-day. I think they
were. But that Spaniards were inherently more
cruel, that is to say, that their hearts were more
wickedly wanton, their sympathies more inhumane,
or that they enjoyed a more ardent pleasure in inflicting
pain upon others than men do now, I do not believe.
The Spaniards were a nation of soldiers, and soldiers
are necessarily cruel. Men go to war to hurt the
enemy, not to be kind to him. Unquestionably the
effect of bull-fights, like the gladiatorial shows of
imperial Rome, was debasing, tending to excite a
love of the bloody and terrible, and to render insipid
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_35' href='#Page_35'>35</a></span>
tamer and more refined amusements. This to them
was a misfortune, although the repulsive sport did
foster a spirit of courage and endurance.
</p>

<p>
The <i>corrida de toros</i>, bull-run, or bull-fight, the
national sport of Spain, is a relic of Moorish chivalry,
yet no less Spanish than Arabic; for the institution
as it exists in Spain is found neither in Africa nor in
Arabia. Originally, as in the ancient tournament,
in the sport engaged only cavaliers, or gentlemen, in
whom were combined such skill and strength that the
head of a bull was sometimes stricken off by a single
blow of the <i>montante</i>. Since which time the tournament
has degenerated into a prize-ring, and the chivalrous
bull-fight which in principle was a display of
courage combined with skill in horsemanship, and in
the use of the lance, has become a sort of dramatic
shambles, where the actors are low-born and mercenary
professionals.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">SPANISH DOMESTIC LIFE.</div>

<p class="p2">
The home life of the Spaniard, which pictures his
softer shades of character, and shows the more delicate
tracings of his mental and moral sensibilities,
must not be disregarded. There alone we shall see
him as he is, stripped of the paraphernalia attending
his appearance before men, with the intents and
purposes of heart and mind laid open before us.
</p>

<p>
We have noticed how the genius of the Mahometan
clung to the soil long after he was driven away; to
this day southern Spain is more Arabic than Gothic.
The towns of Andalusia—of which Cádiz, with its
whitewashed antiquity and its streets and walls clean
as a <i>taza de plata</i>, is the key; and Seville, radiant
with sunny gardens and glittering towers, is the
pride—consist of narrow, tortuous streets walled by
Moorish mansions enclosing cool courts. Shutterless
windows, through which half-muffled lovers whisper
soft nothings to bar-imprisoned <i>señoritas</i>, open without;
fresh young love and musty antiquity thus mingling
in harmonious contrast. Then, favored by the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_36' href='#Page_36'>36</a></span>
voluptuous air of spring, or broiling beneath the enervating
heat of summer, are Granada, Córdova, and
Málaga, where glory and shame, heroic virtue and
unblushing vice, erudition and ignorance, Christianity
and paganism were so blended that the past and
present seem almost one. As if proud of their Moorish
origin, these cities of southern Spain battle with
time, and hold in fast embrace the shadows of departed
grandeur. The better class of Moorish houses
are yet preserved; and the otherwise unendurable
heat of this so-called oven of Spain is rendered supportable
by the narrow, crooked streets—so narrow,
indeed, that in some of them vehicles can not pass
each other—and by the irregular, projecting stories
of the terrace-roofed houses.
</p>

<p>
Though widely separate in their religious systems
much there is alike in the national characteristics of
these grave and haughty sheiks and the Spaniards.
To both were given conquest, wealth, and opportunity.
Both struggled blindly and bravely, sinking into national
decay and corruption, which closed in around
them like a pestilence. But in their religion there
was no doubt a difference. One was sensual, the
other spiritual. In one were the seeds of progress,
of intellectual culture, and of all those enlightenments
and refinements which make men more fit to dominate
this earth. And though the <i>Allah akbar</i> echoes from
the receding hosts who worship God and his prophet,
yet its mission is fulfilled. Where now is the might
of Mauritania? Where the power and pride that caused
Egypt to dream again of the days of the Pharaohs
and the Ptolemies? Syria and Palestine are desolate,
Bedouinized. To Bagdad remains but the memory
of ancient splendor; her palaces are heaps. No more
the good Haroun al Raschid walks her streets; no
more the universities of Kufa and Bassora, Samarcand
and Balkh enlighten the world. The sons of
Hagar have had their day; their work is done. What
Spain and her colonies now are need not here be told.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_37' href='#Page_37'>37</a></span>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">DWELLINGS AND FURNITURE.</div>

<p>
Every Spanish town has its plaza, great square, or
public market-place, which every day presents a busy
scene. Thither in early morning resort the improvident—though
not specially lazy—common people for
their daily supply of food. Then there is the <i>paseo</i>,
or public promenade, or, as it is more frequently
called, the <i>alameda</i>, from <i>álamo</i>, poplar, a beautiful
walk, shaded on either side by trees. There may be
seen every pleasant day after the <i>siesta</i>, or midday
sleep, groups of either sex, and all classes, high and
low, rich and poor, walking to and fro, chatting,
smoking, flirting, drinking in health and content and
merriment with the cool, delicious evening air; while
ladies in carriages and cavaliers on curveting steeds
occupy and enliven the roadway.
</p>

<p>
Numberless kinds of dwellings obtain in various
parts, conspicuous among which are the Asturian
caverns, the subterranean abodes of La Mancha, the
forts of Castile, and the Moorish palaces of Andalusia.
Stone, hewn and unhewn, is the material employed
in mountainous districts;
<i>adobe</i>, or sun-dried
brick, with thatched roof, upon the plains. A common
class of architecture is a windowless parallelogram
divided into two rooms, one for the family, and
the other for the cattle, the attic being used as a
barn. Houses of this kind are built in one and two
stories. An out-house for stores, which is also used
as a sleeping-place for the women, perched on pillars
eight feet high, sometimes stands adjacent. Across
one end of the family room, which, of necessity, is used
for all domestic purposes, extends a fire-place, ten or
fifteen feet in length and six feet in depth, over which
is a large bell-shaped chimney extending out into the
middle of the room. This style of building might
be elaborated, wings added, or the form changed.
Tiled roofs are common, and overhanging eaves.
Some houses are of three or four stories; others run
out long and low upon the ground. More pretentious
dwellings are often in the form of a hollow square,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_38' href='#Page_38'>38</a></span>
with a <i>patio</i> and garden within. Of such are convents
with cloisters, and over them ranges of corridors
and rooms.
</p>

<p>
Among the upper classes the apartments of the
lady consist of an antechamber, or drawing-room, a
boudoir, a bed-room, a dressing-room, and an oratory.
The drawing-room is furnished with tapestry hangings
on which are represented battles and biblical
scenes—war and religion even here; polished oak or
mahogany high-backed chairs, clumsy, and elaborately
carved; in the corners of the room triangular tables
on which stand heavy silver or gold candlesticks with
sperm candles, the light from which is reflected by
small oval Venetian mirrors, in fantastically wrought
gold or silver frames; cupboards with glass doors for
plate, etc. In the boudoir is a toilet-table before
Venetian mirrors profusely draped in handsome lace;
a book-case, work-table, arm-chairs, sacred paintings
and family portraits; in the sleeping-room, a tall
heavy bedstead with damask or velvet curtains, a
crucifix—the image of silver or gold, and the cross
of ivory—with a little basin of holy water near it,
a <i>priedieu</i> and prayer-book; in the dressing-room a
wardrobe, and all necessary toilet appliances; in the
oratory an altar, a crucifix, two or more priedieux,
and, if mass is said, as is often the case in the houses
of the great or wealthy, images of saints by the
masters, with all the accompanying ornaments of devotion.
</p>

<p>
The dwellings of southern Spain, large and small,
lean toward the Arabic in architecture—Arabic decorations,
with second-story balconies; the rooms rich
in carved ceilings, wainscoting, and arabesque; the
entrance from the street in city houses being through
a vestibule and an ornamented iron-grated gate.
During the summer, when the sun's rays strike like
poisoned darts, the family live for the most part in
the patio. There upon the marble pavement, beside
the cooling fountain, and amidst fragrant orange,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_39' href='#Page_39'>39</a></span>
palm, and citron trees, visitors are received, chocolate
drank, and cigarettes smoked. There too they dance
to the music of the guitar, play cards, and take their
siesta.
</p>

<p>
To oriental customs may be attributed the jealous
privacy by which the women of Spain were guarded
by husbands and fathers. Besides her natural weakness,
woman was yet inferior, inept, characterless, not
to be trusted. The fortress-like houses of the better
sort, which are scattered all over the table-land of the
Peninsula, with their spacious inner court and iron-barred
windows, were so arranged that the part
occupied by the female members of the household
was separate from the more public rooms of the men.
This precinct was unapproachable by any but the
most intimate friend or invited guest. Their domestic
policy, like every other, was suspicious and guarded.
</p>

<p>
This is further illustrated by the mode of entering
a house, which also shows the effect of centuries of
warfare upon manners. In outer doors, and in those
of distinct floors, and apartments, was inserted a small
grate and slide. On knocking, the slide moved back,
and at the grating appeared the lustrous, searching
eyes of the inmate. "Quien es?" Who is it? was the
salutation from within. "Gente de paz." Peaceful
people, was the reply.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">WOMEN AND DRESS.</div>

<p class="p2">
Extreme sensitiveness with regard to dress characterizes
Spaniards of the better sort, and rather than
appear in public unbecomingly attired, they remain
hidden at home, only stealing out for necessities at nightfall,
or perhaps in the early morn, and then back to their
home for the day. In this we see a strong mixture
of pride and <i>bienséance</i>, in which there is more sensitiveness
than sense. But man can not live by reason
alone. He who in this factitious world is guided
only by the instincts of a sound mind, regardless of
the frivolities of fashion, of <i>convenance</i>, indifferent to
his neighbor's ideas of propriety, and to any taste
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_40' href='#Page_40'>40</a></span>
except his own, commits a mistake. Though he alone
is wise, and all the world fools, yet of necessity he
must become foolish, else he is not wise.
</p>

<p>
Males, in their costume, were the birds of gay
plumage at the beginning of the sixteenth century.
So fantastically clad was the English nobleman in his
laced doublet and open gown, that he was scarcely to
be distinguished from a woman. In the time of
Charles V. courtiers dressed in bright colors, but
with his sombre son Philip, all was black—black
velvet trimmed with jet; and stiff—stiff collars, and
stiff black truncated cone hats, with brim scarcely an
inch wide, in place of the soft slouchy <i>sombrero</i>.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE MANTILLA AND CAPA.</div>

<p>
The national and characteristic garment of both
sexes in Spain for about three centuries was, for the
outer covering, the <i>capa</i>, or cloak, of the cavalier, and
the <i>mantilla</i> of the lady. In the reign of Charles
V. the former was a short cape, and the latter
simply a head-dress; but with time both enlarged
until one reached below the knee, and the other below
the waist. Some writers give to these garments a
remote antiquity. They point to ancient coins where
Iberia is represented as a veiled woman, and ignoring
sex claim that to the Iberians the Romans gave the
<i>toga</i>, and that for fifteen centuries the fashion continued.
Others deny such connection. It is undoubtedly
true that the capa of the sixteenth century
was much shorter than the cloak of to-day, being a
cape rather than a cloak, and not at all resembling
the Roman toga. Sebastian Franc in his <i>Weltbuch</i>,
Tübingen, 1534, writes: "Their women wear a curious
dress around the neck; they have an iron band to
which are fastened bent prongs reaching over the
head, over which, when they desire it, they draw a
cloth for the protection of the head, and this they
hold to be a great ornament." To the men and
women of Spain this garment is as the shell to the
turtle; within it, though on a crowded thoroughfare,
they may at any moment retire from the world, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_41' href='#Page_41'>41</a></span>
ensconce themselves within themselves. The cavalier
with a peculiar fling, utterly unattainable by a foreigner,
throws the skirt over the breast and shoulder
so as to partially or completely hide the face according
to his pleasure. On the way to and from church
the lady's face is covered; and the gallant sighing
for a glimpse of features divinely fair, is obliged to
enter the sanctuary, hide behind a column near the
altar; then as one female after another approaches,
kneels, and unveils, he may feast his eyes on the faces
before him. The mantilla serves as a bonnet, veil,
and shawl; formerly it was but an oblong piece of
cloth, with velvet or lace border; later a lace veil was
added as part of it; and now the Spanish female
face is becoming more and more visible in public.
</p>

<p>
The capa is indispensable to the Spaniard; it fits
his nature like a glove, and is almost a part of him.
It may be worn over a rich dress, or it may conceal
rags or nakedness; it may cover a noble, generous
heart, or a multitude of sins. Hidden beneath it, in
secret the wearer may work out his purpose, though
in the market-place. It keeps out the cold; it may
hide the assassin's dagger; it serves as a disguise in
love intrigues, and is a grateful protection from importunate
creditors. Twisted round the left arm, it
is a shield; at night, it is a bed; and with a sword,
<i>capa y espada</i>, it not unfrequently constitutes the entire
earthly possessions of the haughty, poverty-stricken
cavalier. Whatever be the character or condition
of the wearer, dignity is lent him by its ample
folds, and comeliness by its graceful drapery. It is
an unpardonable breach of decorum for a muffled
cavalier to address a person, or for any one to speak
to him while so muffled. Politeness teaches him to
throw open to his friend both his garment and his
heart, that it may be plain that no concealed weapon
is in the one, or malice in the other. A son dare
not speak to his own father when his face is covered
by his cloak.

The peasantry flaunted the gayest and most picturesque
attire on holiday occasions; the <i>majo</i>, a
rustic beau, wore a figured velvet waistcoat with
square velvet buttons, and brilliant with colored ribbons;
embroidered stockings, silver-buckled shoes,
and a colored capa thrown gracefully over the left
shoulder. The dress of Fígaro in the play, is that of
an Andalusian dandy. The costume of Valencia is
more Asiatic, or Asiatic-antique it might be called,
partaking somewhat, as it does, of the ancient Greek
costume—wide linen drawers, linen shirt, hempen
sandals, footless stockings, wide red woollen belt, gay
velvet jacket with silken sash, with a colored capa
over all. The long hair is bound by a silken band
in the form of a turban. The female peasant dress is
no less showy; a red velvet bodice, with scarlet or
purple petticoat, all profusely embroidered, a gay-colored
square-cut mantilla fastened by a silver
brooch, with chains and jewels and colored stones
according to the purse of the wearer.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">VARIOUS COSTUMES.</div>

<p>
The ordinary peasant dress of Estremadura consists
of wide cloth knee-breeches, closely resembling
those of the Moors, a gabardine of cloth or leather,
and cloth leggings. The men wear the hair long.
The women have a fashion of putting on a great
number of petticoats; the rustic belles of Zamarramala,
a village of Estremadura, manage to carry
from fourteen to seventeen. In Andalusia the men
have short jackets ornamented with jet or steel beads,
knee-breeches, and highly ornamented leathern leggings;
the women wear short embroidered and
flounced petticoats, and a Moorish sleeveless jacket
embroidered with gold or silver and laced in front.
Asturian peasants have wooden shoes with three
large nails in the soles, which keep them from the
ground; leathern shoes they frequently carry in their
travels, and to and from church, under their arms, or
on their heads, putting them on just before entering
the village or church. The women wear ear-rings
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_43' href='#Page_43'>43</a></span>
and necklaces of glass imitation of coral; a handkerchief,
folded triangularly, covers the head; at funerals,
a large black mantle is worn. The Castilians wear
sandals, called <i>abarcas</i>, tied to the ankle by narrow
strips of rawhide. The Estremadurans wear a hat,
very broad-brimmed; the Catalonians, a red Phrygian
cap; the Valencians, a kind of Greek cap; the
Asturians, a three-cornered black or dark blue cap
with velvet facings; the Biscayans, a flat red woollen
cap; the Andalusians, a turban-like hat, or a silk
handkerchief. In Aragon, as well as in some of the
southern provinces, the broad-brimmed slouching sombrero
obtains. Hats were invented by a Swiss, Pansian,
in 1404, and a Spaniard first manufactured them
in London in 1510. Jews in Spain were obliged to
wear yellow hats; in Germany bankrupts, in like
manner, were required to wear hats of green and
yellow.
</p>

<p>
The general costume of a Spanish nobleman consisted
of a silk gabardine, with sleeves close-fitting at
the wrist but puffed and slashed between the elbow
and shoulder so as to show the fine linen shirt beneath;
chamois-skin doublet, thick but flexible; silk
hose, and silk trowsers slashed; long bell-shaped
boots with golden spur-supporters; broad, polished
leathern belt, from which hung a long sword on the
left side, and a long dagger in a leathern or velvet
scabbard on the right; a round, soft, broad-brimmed
beaver hat, with an ostrich-feather fastened by a diamond
brooch on the side or in front; a cape or cloak
embroidered or laced with gold or silver thread, fastened
with cord and tassel, and worn hanging from
the left shoulder, or thrown around the body so as to
cover part of the face. Within doors, the cloak was
laid aside; a velvet doublet was substituted for the
leathern one; and instead of boots, shoes of leather
or velvet, slashed over the toes, were worn. The
dress of the lady was a heavy, flowing brocade or
velvet skirt, open in front, displaying an underdress
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_44' href='#Page_44'>44</a></span>
of light silk or satin; a chemisette with slashed
sleeves; a stomacher with long ends hanging in front,
and a velvet sleeveless jacket laced with gold or silver
cord. The breast was covered with lace, and the
neck and shoulders were bare, except when covered
by the <i>toca</i>, a kind of head-dress, out of which by
elongation grew the characteristic mantilla. Her
shoes were of velvet, her stockings of silk or wool;
from the waist on the right side hung a reticule, a
silver or gold whistle for calling servants, and a
poniard. Her <i>dueña</i> wore a black skirt, and a large
black mantle completely covering the head, face,
and shoulders down to the waist. Swords formed
no part of domestic dress prior to the fifteenth
century.
</p>

<p>
Black was the color of the church, certain clerical
orders excepted. Those of the learned professions
wore black. The ladies usually attended church
in black, and indeed were sometimes seen in sombre
hues upon the alameda. Black robes and a canoe-shaped
hat covered the Basque priest; and the friar,
sackcloth and gray, bound round the waist with a
twisted cord. <i>Alguaciles</i>, or constables, followed the
ancient cavalier costume—broad-brimmed hat, black
cloak, short knee-breeches, black stockings, silver-buckled
shoes, Vandyke ruffles, and white lace collar.
This in the Basque provinces only. Friars appeared
in a hooded robe, extending to the ankles,
over woollen breeches and jacket. A cord was tied
round the waist from which hung a rosary. Hempen
or leathern shoes were worn, and by some orders
broad hats. The robe of the friar was of coarse wool;
that of the clergyman serge, with a cloak, low leathern
shoes with buckle, black stockings, knee-breeches, a
white collar, and a black hat with broad brim turned
up at the sides. The robes of vicars, parish curates,
and other church dignitaries were of silk. The Franciscan's
robe was of a yellowish gray color, the
Dominican's white, the Carmelite's reddish gray, the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_45' href='#Page_45'>45</a></span>
Capuchin's silver gray, the Jesuit's black. The
bishop's color was violet, the cardinal's red or purple.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Domestic routine in Spain, with allowances for
class, season, and locality, was substantially as follows.
The noble or wealthy master of a household was
served before rising with chocolate, which service was
called the <i>desayuno</i>. He then rose and dressed;
after which, kneeling before the crucifix, he said a
prayer; then he proceeded to the avocations of the
day, taking <i>las once</i>, or the eleven o'clock luncheon
of cake and wine, either at home or at the house of a
friend, or wherever he happened to be. After a
twelve or one o'clock dinner came the siesta. At
five o'clock there was to be eaten the <i>merienda</i>, consisting
of chocolate, preserved fruit, and ices; and between
nine and eleven, supper. In the private chapel
of the grandees mass was said. The middle class
usually attended church about sunrise; after which
breakfast, and at noon dinner.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">EXCESSIVE RELIGIOUS TRAINING.</div>

<p>
The religious training of children was excessive.
At daybreak the <i>angelus</i> was recited, then to chapel
or church to mass, after which the child might breakfast;
at noon angelus and dinner; after the siesta
vespers at church, and rosary at home; at six o'clock
angelus and chocolate; prayers at eight; supper at
nine; after which more prayers and to bed. The
child was expected to attend all these devotions, the
night prayer perhaps excepted, the youngest children
being sent to bed after the rosary. And this not
alone Sunday, but every day.
</p>

<p>
A national dish, centuries old, common to Spain
and all Spanish countries, called the <i>olla podrida</i>,
constitutes a staple food with almost all classes.
It is made of meat and vegetables boiled together,
but usually served in two dishes, and its constituents
depend upon the resources of the cook, for everything
eatable is put into it that can be obtained.
Beef, mutton, pork, and fowl; beans, peas, potatoes,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_46' href='#Page_46'>46</a></span>
onions, cabbage, and garlic; the water in which the
mess is boiled is served as soup with rice or bread,
and the two courses constitute the whole of every
meal of the lower classes. On the tables of the
wealthy, after the olla podrida, fish, roast meats, and
a profuse dessert of sweetmeats, jellies, preserves,
and bonbons are served. The Andalusians make a
salad of cucumbers, tomatoes, lettuce, green-peppers,
chiccory, with oil, vinegar, salt, pepper, and stale
bread, which with them is a staple dish, called <i>gazpacho</i>.
</p>

<p>
It was a gluttonous, sensual age, that of the
century preceding our epoch; but from these vices
Spain was probably more free than any other civilized
nation of Europe. There the discipline of war absorbed
the attention which elsewhere was given to
luxurious living. We find nothing in Spain such as
we are told about in England, where the households
of the great were composed of brawling retainers,
ill-mannered clowns, and riotous serving men and
women who terminated many a feast with bloodshed;
where guests snatched and scrambled for food, gorging
themselves with whatever they could lay hands
on; where drunken broils were of daily occurrence,
and the master of the household was not unfrequently
obliged to sheath his sword in the body of some contumacious
servant grown dangerous by the unbridled
license in which he had been indulged.
</p>

<p>
What shall we say of the monks and cardinals
now grown fat from the well filled coffers of the
Church? With their wealth in some instances they
had grown sensuous and extravagant. Their cupboards
were loaded with rich viands, in which they
freely indulged; and their tables were surrounded by
musicians and all the luxuries and delicacies the world
could contribute. Not to the faults of the few, however,
would we call too much attention, but to the
virtues of the many; for during these dark years of
ignorance and voluptuousness the Church was planting
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_47' href='#Page_47'>47</a></span>
and watering the seeds of the sanctity of marriage
and domestic life in Spain, and surrounding the family
altar with so many safeguards among her people, that
the long ages since have not sufficed to dispel nor
destroy them. The wealthy families of Spain had
their court jesters, but coarse buffoonery or indecent
jests were seldom tolerated.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">FOOD AND FILTHINESS.</div>

<p>
Two persons often ate from one plate, using their
fingers for forks. A sheath-knife, or dagger, which
they carried upon the person, served to cut the food.
Among the first books printed in Venice was a folio
volume on cookery, issued in 1475. In the English
metrical <i>Stans Puer ad Mensam</i>, following Wright,
the guest is told to "bring no knyves unskoured
to the table;" in other words, his sheath knife
should be clean, and he is also informed that polite
persons will not pick their teeth with it while at
table. It was considered a breach of good manners
to blow the nose with the same fingers used in conveying
food to the mouth. Hats were worn by the
men, and head-dresses by the women, on all domestic
occasions. In France, the metrical <i>Contenances de
Table</i>, or manual of table manners, shows but little
more refinement there than elsewhere. Among other
directions the reader is told first to examine his seat
whether it be clean:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Enfant, prens de regarder peine</p>
<p>Sur le siege où tu te fierras,</p>
<p>Se aucune chose y verras</p>
<p>Qui soit deshonneste où vilaine."</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
He is forbidden to spit upon the table while at
dinner:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Ne craiche par dessus la table</p>
<p>Car c'est chose desconvenable."</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
Or to spurt water from his mouth into the basin used
in common by the company:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Quant tu bouche tu laveras</p>
<p>Ou bacin point ne cracheras."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_48' href='#Page_48'>48</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Or leave sops in his wine glass:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Se tu fais souppes en ton verre</p>
<p>Boy le vin ou le gette à terre."</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
But by implication he may spurt and throw remnants
on the floor, as much as he pleases.
</p>

<p>
Even in their use of tobacco, of which they are excessively
fond, the Spaniards are temperate. Though
they smoke it almost constantly, it is in such small
quantities, and in so mild a form, that tobacco does
them less injury than it inflicts on many other nations.
It was the custom to carry a daily supply
wrapped in a lettuce or cabbage leaf to preserve it
moist. The cigarette was prepared for smoking by
taking a small quantity of tobacco, finely cut, rolling
it in a piece of corn-husk or paper, and lighting with
flint, steel, and punk. Though the tobacco may be
strong, prepared in this way the effect is less injurious
than when rolled in larger quantities into a cigar,
or cut from a plug and smoked from a pipe or
chewed.
</p>

<p>
Noble youths of both sexes were accustomed, to
serve a sort of apprenticeship for a number of years
in the king's household. In like manner the sons
and daughters of gentlemen served in the houses of
the nobility, and common people in the houses of
gentlemen, that each might be benefited by the
knowledge and refinement of his superior.
</p>

<p>
Spaniards, as I have said, are called inhospitable;
but this charge must be taken with allowance.
Every phase of human nature has its generous
quality; locked in every heart is a wealth of kindliness
which opens to him who holds the key. By
nature these people are reserved, suspicious. They
carry no window in their breast. In their domestic
affairs they are specially reticent before strangers.
Their wives and daughters they hide away; their
troubles they cover within the ashes that preserve
them; their sensibilities shrink from cold contact with
the world. If some find certain Spaniards at given
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_49' href='#Page_49'>49</a></span>
periods inhospitable, others at other times and places
find them very generous. In early times inns were
not common in Spain, and we are told that in certain
places every private house had its guest's quarters
consisting of one or more rooms according to the
opulence of the owner. To this apartment every
stranger of whatsoever degree was welcome. There
he lived as long as he pleased, fed and cared for by
the host; and—you may call it pride—if through
poverty provisions grew scarce, the family would
undergo the greatest privation rather than the guest
should suffer want, or be forced to hasten his departure.
Furthermore all was free; to offer pay for
entertainment was deemed an insult, though a present
might be given and accepted.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">AMUSEMENTS.</div>

<p class="p2">
While called a melancholy people, amusement
appeared at times to be the life of the nation.
Royalty and religion at rest, peace here and hereafter
secured, there was nothing more of life than to enjoy
it. To labor when one might repose; to sigh when
one might sing; to undergo the pains of culture when
sweet pleasure temptingly proposed a holiday—ah
no! Fools attempt to better their condition and
make it worse. Let those who need improving scour
themselves; we know enough.
</p>

<p>
So lazily lapped in stupidity, beside their feast-days
and bull-fights, their passions and passion-plays, they
lolled upon the greensward and danced to tambourine
and castanets, and wrestled, and ran races; they
fenced, fought, played cards, shook dice, and enlivened
home monotony by all sorts of games and gymnastic
exercises. Dancing was carried to such excess
as to lead to dissoluteness and occasional death, even
as it does to-day. The dances of the peasantry in
many instances bear a striking resemblance to those
of the native races of America. In Asturias, men,
and sometimes men and women, form a circle joining
hands by the little finger. A leader sings in plaintive
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_50' href='#Page_50'>50</a></span>
monotone a description of some Spanish feat of arms
prior to the eleventh century, or of a tournament of
later days, or of some unhappy love adventure, or of
a thrilling incident in the conquest of America. At
the end of every strophe, all sing in chorus the refrain
which sometimes terminates in an invocation, as for
example, May Saint Peter be with me! May the
Magdalen protect us! The dance is a long step forward,
and two short steps backward and laterally to
the right, so that the circle keeps constantly moving
in that direction, meanwhile keeping time to the
music with arms as well as feet. These dances
take place on Sunday afternoons, and on feast-days,
and when the priest is present men and women are
separated in the dance. The <i>fandango</i>, danced by
two persons with castanets to the music of the guitar,
is peculiar to the south of Spain.
</p>

<p>
Between the eras proper of tournaments and bull-fights,
a species of tilting called <i>correr la sortija</i> was
greatly in vogue. A gold finger-ring was suspended
by a thread from the top of a pole, and at it charged
the cavalier with lance in rest and horse at full speed.
The smallness of the object, its constant motion, and
its proximity to the pole rendered it an exceedingly
difficult feat to accomplish.
</p>

<p>
Cards and dice were at this time in the height of
their fascination. Every class, age, profession, and
sex were filled with a passion for gambling—a most
levelling vice, at this juncture, bringing in contact
noble and commoner, knight and squire, women, servants,
and trades-people. An English poet about
the year 1500 thus laments the degeneracy of the
nobles:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Before thys tyme they lovyd for to juste,</p>
<p class="i1">  And in shotynge chefely they sett ther mynde;</p>
<p>And ther landys and possessyons now sett they moste,</p>
<p class="i1">And at cardes and dyce ye may them ffynde."</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
From her low estate of mediæval drudge or plaything,
woman was lifted by the exaltation of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_51' href='#Page_51'>51</a></span>
Virgin,—lifted too high by chivalry; then fell too
low with the sensual reaction. Finally, after many
waverings, she rises again, and in the more favored
spheres takes her rightful place beside her lord,
his confidant and equal. At the time of which I
write, however, she was less respected than now, and
hence less respectable; less trusted, and consequently
less trustworthy. Her virtue, fortified by bolts and
bars at home, was watched by servants abroad.
Falling into the customs of the invaders during
Moslem domination, Castilian ladies became more
and more retired, until the dwelling was little better
than a nunnery. The days of tournaments, and
jousts, and troubadours were over, and indifference
succeeded chivalric sentimentality.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">FEMALE CHASTITY.</div>

<p>
Seldom has Spanish society been conspicuous for its
high moral tone. Female chastity was an abstract
quality, the property of the father or husband, rather
than an inherent virtue for the safe-keeping of which
the female possessor was responsible. The master of
a household exercised sovereign authority therein,
claiming even the power of life and death over the
members of his family. He was addressed in the
third person as 'your worship;' sons dare not cover
their head, cross their legs, or even sit in his presence
unless so directed; daughters were betrothed without
their knowledge, and to men whom they had never
seen; the selection of a husband rested entirely with
the father, and the daughter had only to acquiesce.
Female decorum and purity were placed under
espionage. A dueña kept guard over the wife and
daughter at home, and closely followed at their heels
whenever they stepped into the street. Ladies,
closely veiled, marched solemnly to church, preceded
by a <i>rodrigon</i>, or squire, with cushion and prayer-book,
and followed by a dueña. At service, her place
was in front, and men took up their station behind
her. Teach woman first that she is inferior, next
that she is impotent; add to this intellectual inanity
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_52' href='#Page_52'>52</a></span>
and implied moral unaccountability, and you have a
creature ripe for wickedness.
</p>

<p>
This excess of caution defeated its own purpose.
Women, left much alone within their cloister-like
homes, waited not in vain for opportunity. The gay
mistress could often too easily win over her attendant,
and make of her dueña a go-between; yet if we may
believe the record, infidelity was rare, and for two
reasons. First, woman in her seclusion escaped many
temptations; and secondly, a wholesome fear, the certainty
that vengeance, swift and sure, would follow
the offence, resulting in the death of one or both offenders,
placed a curb on passion. Females of the
lower classes, left alone to take care of their virtue as
best they might, with faces open and actions free,
were less given to transgression than their wealthier
sisters.
</p>

<p>
Lewd women could not testify in criminal cases.
Respectable women were permitted to testify, but
the judge was obliged to wait on them at their
homes, as they were not allowed to attend court.
Learning to write was discouraged in females, as they
could then have it in their power to scribble love-letters
to their gallants. Queen Isabella did much
to elevate and purify both religion and morals. The
court of Enrique IV., her predecessor, has been described
as but little better than a brothel, where "the
queen, a daughter of Portugal, lived openly with her
parasites and gallants, as the king did with his minions
and mistresses." Maids of honor were trained
courtesans, and the noblemen of the court occupied
their time in illicit amours and love intrigues. From
the king on his throne to his lowest subject, all who
could afford it kept a mistress.
</p>

<p>
Ware states that within a century the widows
of Madrid were "compelled to pass the whole first
year of their mourning in a chamber entirely hung
with black, where not a single ray of the sun could
penetrate, seated on a little mattress with their legs
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_53' href='#Page_53'>53</a></span>
always crossed. When this year was over, they retired
to pass the second year in a chamber hung with
grey." This savagism is paralleled by the Thlinkeets
of Alaska, who at certain times confine women in a
little kennel for six months, giving them one a size
larger for the second six months; likewise by the
Tacullies of New Caledonia, who make the widow
carry the deceased husband's ashes upon her back in
a bag for one or two years.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">EUROPEAN SOCIETY IN GENERAL.</div>

<p>
A glance at English and French society shows us,
however, that the character of the Spanish women of
this epoch compared favorably with that of their
northern sisters. Though perhaps no chaster than
the French, they were not street-brawlers like the
English women. These latter, we are told, from
whom the men would separate themselves in their
debauches, would likewise assemble at the public
house, drink their ale, talk loudly and lewdly, and
gossip, swear, and fight. In a religious play of the
period, representing the deluge, Noah, when ready to
enter the ark, seeks his wife, and finds her carousing
with her gossips at the public drink-house.
</p>

<p>
"Young ladies, even of great families," says
Wright, "were brought up not only strictly but even
tyrannically by their mothers, who kept them constantly
at work, exacted from them almost slavish
deference and respect, and even counted upon their
earnings." A mother in those days was accounted a
little severe who beat her daughter "once in the
week, or twice, and sometimes twice a day," and
"broke her head in two or three places," or still worse,
permitted her to "speak with no man, whosoever
come."
</p>

<p>
Witness the wooing of Matilda of Flanders by
William the Conqueror. Having had the audacity
to refuse him, the noble suitor entered her home,
seized her long tresses, dragged her about the floor,
struck her; then flinging her from him, he spurned
her with his foot. Matilda at once accepted him,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_54' href='#Page_54'>54</a></span>
saying: "He must be a man of courage who dare beat
me in my father's palace."
</p>

<p>
Pedro el Cruel, king of Castile and Leon, about the
middle of the fourteenth century held good, and commanded,
under heavy penalties, that no one of the
laboring classes, man or woman, who was able to work,
should be found begging. He fixed the day's wage
of every class with the most punctilious exactitude.
Shoemakers, tailors, armorers, and others who worked
by the job, had a definite price attached to the making
of every article. A shoe of such and such leather,
made after such a fashion, with a double or single
sole; a cloak, lined or unlined; a weapon of an ordinary,
or of a superior temper and finish—each article
in its fabrication was to cost just so much and no
more.
</p>

<p>
It was an age of interference in the affairs of men,
the strong against the weak. It was in these trade
regulations, and in sumptuary laws, the superstition
of political economy and social statics, that the science
of ignorance culminated. It was then that learned
men threw dust into the air, cast a cloud about their
own intellect, and labored hard to inculcate the principles
of nescience into the minds of men. In England
the number of servants a nobleman might have
was fixed by law, as was also costume, and the number
of courses at dinner. Soup and two dishes legally
constituted a Frenchman's dinner in 1340.
</p>

<p>
Ferdinand and Isabella were, perhaps, the most
parentally inclined of all. No affair, religious, moral,
political, judicial, economical, literary, industrial,
mechanical, or mercantile could escape their attention.
From the regulation and organization of the
high councils, and of the civil and ecclesiastical
tribunals, to the ordinances for the leather-dressers
and cloth-shearers; from the decrees concerning the
universities and the literary and scientific bodies,
to the orders that prescribed the weight of horseshoes;
from the general laws on commerce and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_55' href='#Page_55'>55</a></span>
navigation, to those which fixed the expenditure at
weddings and baptisms, and the amount of wax to
be burned at funerals; from the highest interests and
rights of religion and of the throne, down to the most
humble and mechanical industries—all were considered,
legislated upon, and seen to by their Catholic
Majesties, with infinite pains and vigilance. In 1510,
thinking the colonists of Española too fond of ostentation
and extravagance, Ferdinand issued a proclamation,
forbidding them to wear rich silks, brocades,
or gold or silver lace. Owners of vessels, in times of
peace, were forced to engage at fixed prices in perilous
voyages of discovery or commerce.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">SUMPTUARY LAWS.</div>

<p>
In England it appears that the dress of the
men commanded the special attention of their rulers.
Spaniards made men and women alike to feel the iron
heel of sumptuary legislation; while the English, in
laws of nearly coincident date, for the most part
omitted the sex. By distinctive qualities, Edward
IV., 1461-1483, regulated the dress of his people—from
the royal cloth-of-gold down to the two-shillings-a-yard,
and under, cloth of the laboring classes; but,
if we may believe Sanford, he took care to exempt his
women subjects from the provisions of this act, save
only the wives of the two-shillings-a-yard boor,
who might be expected to have other things to
attend to.
</p>

<p>
The continental ladies, it appears, could flaunt it
bravely upon occasion, at least in France and Flanders.
For through these countries crusaded, in 1428,
Thomas Conecte, a Carmelite friar, preaching against
the evils of the age, or what he considered as such.
Among these, dress held a place, and many other
things not generally condemned at present. His
manner of going to work was peculiar, and is pretty
well described by Monstrelet.
</p>

<p>
In his audiences he always separated the men from
the women by a cord, "for he had observed some sly
doings between them while he was preaching." Having
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_56' href='#Page_56'>56</a></span>
taken these wise precautions, he was accustomed
earnestly to admonish his hearers "on the damnation
of their souls and on pain of excommunication, to
bring to him whatever backgammon-boards, chessboards,
nine-pins, or other instruments for games
of amusement they might possess." Right bitterly
would he then attack the luxurious apparel of ladies
of rank; especially the monstrous head-gear which
was in fashion at that time; all of which bred trouble,
as may readily be imagined, and produced no good
results.
</p>

<p>
We see the same style of preaching indulged in
by the Wesleys in England and Whitefield and others
in America at different times, and ever with the
same lack of practical results. The most costly jewelry,
the finest apparel, grand houses and free living
are as conspicuous among the followers of these
self-sacrificing and conscientious men as among the
members of any other church, or among those who
are not members of any church. And if the pious
Carmelite friar failed in his crusade against fine
clothes, free living, and monstrous head-gear among
the Spanish of the fifteenth century, so have more
modern crusaders failed in similar attempts in later
times.
</p>

<p class="p2">
This then was Spain and Spanish character, as
nearly as I have been able to picture them in the
short space allotted, at or prior to the dawn of the
sixteenth century. We have found Spaniards the
noblest race on earth at that time; their men brave,
their women modest. Before them opened a career
more brilliant than the world has ever seen before or
since. To follow them in some parts of that career
is the purpose of these volumes.
</p>

<p>
We have found these people after all not so very
different from ourselves—more loyal than we, but
more ignorant; more religious, but more superstitious;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_57' href='#Page_57'>57</a></span>
more daring, but more reckless; more enthusiastic,
but more chimerical. They were endowed with
the virtues and vices of their age, as we are with the
virtues and vices of ours. They were sincere in their
opinions, and honest in their efforts; but we have the
advantage of them by four centuries of recorded experiences.
Our knowledge, our advantages, are superior
to theirs; do we make superior use of them?
Spain lighted a hemisphere of dark waters, brought
forth hidden islands and continents, and presented
half a world to the other half. With all our boasted
improvement, have we done more?
</p>

<p>
It is the custom of historical commentators to
praise and to blame <i>ad libitum</i>. This is right if it
be done judiciously. We should praise discreetly,
and blame with steadiness. But there is really little
to praise or to blame in history, and most of it that
is done is simply praising or blaming the providence
of progress. Would you blame the Spanish people
for being ignorant, submissive, and cruel? They were
as God and circumstances made them. Would you
blame their king and princes for domineering them?
They were as the people and circumstances made them.
The people were indignant if their rulers did not
impose upon them. Says Grenville, writing in his
memoirs so late as 1818: "The Regent drives in the
park every day in a tilbury, with his groom sitting
by his side; grave men are shocked at this undignified
practice."
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, amidst the many so-called spirits which
in this epoch hovered over man, the spirit of discovery
was not the least potent. Curiosity, the mother
of science, became the mother of new worlds; gave
birth to continents, islands, and seas; gave form
and boundary to earth. Over the sea, the mists of
the Dark Age had rested with greater density even
than on land. The aurora of progress now illumined
the western horizon as of old it did the eastern.
Hitherto the great ocean, beyond a few leagues from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_58' href='#Page_58'>58</a></span>
shore, was a mystery. As may be seen depicted on
ancient charts, it was filled, in the imaginations of
navigators, with formidable water-beasts and monsters,
scarcely less terrible than those that Æneas saw as
he entered the mouth of Hades:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Multaque præterea variarum monstra ferarum:</p>
<p>Centauri in foribus stabulant, Scyllæque biformes,</p>
<p>et centumgeminus Briareus, ac belua Lernæ</p>
<p>horrendum stridens, flammisque armata Chimæra,</p>
<p>Gorgones Harpyiæque et forma tricorporis umbræ."</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
Ancient geographers affirmed that the heat of the
torrid zone was intolerable, that men and ships entering
it would shrivel. This belt of consuming heat
presented an impenetrable barrier between the known
and the unknown.
</p>

<p>
What wonder that intellect was stunted, civilization
dwarfed, restricted as was human knowledge to
the narrow grave-like walls of western Europe! No
sooner were these ancient boundaries burst, and the
black and dreadful fog-banks which lay upon primeval
ocean pierced, than fancy, like a freed bird, bounded
forth, swept the circumference of the earth, soared
aloft amid the stars, and dared even to ask of religion
a reason.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">EUROPE AND AMERICA.</div>

<p class="p2">
One glance westward. On either side of an unswept
sea, a Sea of Darkness it was called by those
that feared it, there rested at the opening of this
history two fair continents, each unknown to the
other. One was cultivated; its nations were well
advanced in those arts and courtesies that spring
from accumulated experiences; the other, for the
most part, unmarred by man, lay revelling in primeval
beauty, fresh as from the Creator's hand. The leaven
of progress working in one, brought to its knowledge
the existence of the other; the Sea of Darkness with
its uncouth monsters was turned into a highway, and
civilized Europe stood face to face with sylvan
America. This world newly found was called the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_59' href='#Page_59'>59</a></span>
New World; though which is the new and which the
old; which, if either, peopled the other, is yet undetermined.
One in organism and in the nature human,
the people of the two worlds were in color, customs,
and sentiment several. The barbarous New World
boasted its civilizations, while the civilized Old World
disclosed its barbarisms; on Mexican and Peruvian
highlands were nations of city-builders as far superior
in culture to the islanders and coast-dwellers seen
by Columbus, as were the European discoverers superior
to the American highlanders. Of probable
indigenous origin, this lesser civilization shows traces
of high antiquity; even the ruder nations of the
north leave far behind them absolute primevalism.
</p>

<p>
I do not say with some that in America were seen
in certain directions marks of as high culture as any
in Europe. There were no such marks. But this
unquestionably is true; that, as in Europe, we here
find that most inexplicable of phenomena, the evolution
of civility; man's mental and spiritual necessities,
like his physical wants, appear everywhere the same.
The mind, like the body, craves nutriment, and the
dimmed imprisoned soul a higher sympathy; hence
we see men of every clime and color making for
themselves gods, and contriving creeds which shall
presently deliver them from their dilemma. The
civilizations of America, unlike well-rooted saplings
of Egypt, Greece, and Rome, were sensitive-plants
which collapsed upon the first foreign touch, leaving
only the blackness of darkness; hence it was the wild
tribes, far more than the cultivated nations, that
influenced the character of subsequent American societies.
</p>

<p>
In her civil and religious polities America was
every whit as consistent as Europe. Neither was
altogether perfect or wise; and we wonder at the
blindness and stupidity of one as of the other.
Although we could catch but a glimpse of the Americans
before they vanished, yet we might see that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_60' href='#Page_60'>60</a></span>
intellect was not stationary, but growing, and that
society was instinct with intelligent and progressional
activity.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">COMPARATIVE RELIGIONS.</div>

<p>
In their religions the Americans paralleled the
rest of mankind. Every religion derives its form
and color from the mind of the worshippers, so that
by their gods we may know them. From elevated
natures emanate chaste and refined conceptions of
the deity; from brutish natures coarse conceptions.
Christianity is the highest and purest of all religions;
but if we study the moral precepts of the foremost
American nations, we shall see that in many respects
they were not far behind, and were indeed in some instances
in advance of Christianity. True, the Aztecs
practised human sacrifice, with all its attendant horrors;
but what were the religious wars, the expulsion
of Jews, the slaughter of Infidels, the burning of
heretics, but human sacrifice? Moreover, while we
turn in horror from the sacrificial stone of the Aztecs,
where the human victims were treated as gods and
whence their souls were sent direct to Paradise, yet
we find among them little of that most infamous of
crimes—persecution for opinion's sake; nor yet do
we read of their ingenuity being taxed for the contrivance
of engines of the most excruciating torture, as
we do in the history of Christianity. Tortures which,
while killing the body, it was believed consigned the
soul to eternal agonies.
</p>

<p>
There was little in the social or political systems of
Europe of which the counterpart could not be found
in America; indeed, the economical, social, and political
condition of every civilization finds its counterpart in
every other civilization; and there were institutions
then existing in America at whose feet Europe might
have sat with benefit.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">AMERICAN ABORIGINALS.</div>

<p>
Among the wilder tribes we find prevalent the
patriarchal state, with its hundreds of languages and
theologies; a slight advance from which are those
associations of families banded for safety, thus presenting
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_61' href='#Page_61'>61</a></span>
a state of society not unlike that of European
feudalism. From this point, every quality and grade
of government presents itself until full-blown monarchy
is attained, where a sole sovereign becomes an
emperor of nations with a state and severity equal to
that of the most enlightened. The government of the
Nashua nations, which was monarchical and nearly
absolute, denotes no small progress from primordial
patriarchy.
</p>

<p>
Like their cousins of Spain and England, the sovereigns
of Mexico had their elaborate palaces, with
magnificent surroundings, their country residence and
their hunting-grounds, their botanical and zoological
gardens, and their harems filled with the daughters
of nobles, who deemed it an honor to see them thus
royally defiled. There were aristocratic and knightly
orders; nobles, plebeians, and slaves; pontiffs and
priesthoods; land tenures and taxation; seminaries
of learning, and systems of education, in which virtue
was extolled and vice denounced; laws and law
courts of various grades, and councils and tribunals
of various kinds; military orders with drill, engineer
corps, arms, and fortifications; commerce, caravans,
markets, merchants, pedlers, and commercial fairs,
with a credit system, and express and postal facilities.
</p>

<p>
They were not lacking in pleasures and amusements
similar to those of the Europeans, such as feasts with
professional jester, music, dancing; and after dinner
the drama, national games, gymnastics, and gladiatorial
combats. They were not without their intoxicating
drink, delighting in drunkenness while denouncing it.
Their medical faculty and systems of surgery they
had, and their burial-men; also their literati, scholars,
orators, and poets, with an arithmetical system, a
calendar, a knowledge of astronomy, hieroglyphic
books, chronological records, public libraries, and national
archives.
</p>

<p>
The horoscope of infants was cast; the cross was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_62' href='#Page_62'>62</a></span>
lifted up; incense was burned; baptism and circumcision
were practised. Whence arose these customs
so like those of their fellow-men across the Atlantic,
whom they had never seen or heard of?
</p>

<p>
The conquerors found all this when they entered
the country. They examined with admiration the
manufactures of gold, silver, copper, tin, and lead,
wrought to exquisite patterns with surprising skill.
They gazed with astonishment on huge architectural
piles, on monumental remains speaking louder than
words; on temples, causeways, fountains, aqueducts,
and light-houses, surrounded as they were with statues
and intricate and costly stone carvings. They found
that the Americans made cloth, paper, pottery, and
dyes, and were proficient in painting. Their mosaic
feather-work was a marvel.
</p>

<p>
There are many points of interest, well worth
examination, which I have not space here properly
to mention. The interested reader, however, will find
all material necessary to careful comparison in my
<i><a href="#Native_Races">Native Races of the Pacific States</a></i>. He will there
find described conditions of society analogous to
feudalism and chivalry; he will find municipal governments,
walled towns, and standing armies. There
were legislative assemblies similar to that of the
Cortes, and associations not unlike that of the Holy
Brotherhood. To say that trial by combat sometimes
occurred is affirming of them nothing complimentary;
but upon the absence of some European
institutions they were to be congratulated.
</p>

<p>
Although living lives of easy poverty, the wild
tribes of America everywhere possessed dormant
wealth enough to tempt the cupidity alike of the fierce
Spaniard, the blithe Frenchman, and the sombre Englishman.
Under a burning tropical sun, where neither
meat nor clothing was essential to comfort, the land
yielded gold, while in hyperborean forests where no
precious metals were discovered the richest peltries
abounded; so that no savage in all this northern continent
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_63' href='#Page_63'>63</a></span>
was found so poor that grasping civilization
could find nothing to rob him of.
</p>

<p>
When Europe undertook the mastery of America,
she found the people, as a rule, ready to be friendly.
Some at first were startled into the seizure of their
arms, the first impulse of the wild man on meeting
anything strange being to defend himself. But their
fears were easily allayed, their confidence easily
gained, and their pledges of good faith were usually
to be depended upon.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">COMPARATIVE CHARACTERISTICS.</div>

<p>
The variations between them and their brethren
across the Atlantic were less of kind than of quality.
They were more children than wild beasts. Physically
they were complete, but mentally they were not
fully developed. Their minds were not so broad, nor
so strong or subtle as those of white men. Their
cunning partook more of brute instinct than of civilized
artifice. There was mind-power enough, but it
lacked shape and consistency. They were naturally
no more blood-thirsty, or cruel, or superstitious than
their conquerors, but their cruelty and superstitions
were of coarser, cruder forms. The American aboriginal
character has been greatly misconstrued, and
is to-day but imperfectly understood.
</p>

<p>
The chief difference, or cause of difference, between
the people of Europe and the more advanced
nations of America, it seems to me, lay in the ignorance
of some few things, apparently insignificant
in themselves, yet mighty enough to revolutionize
Christendom; such as the use of iron, gunpowder,
and movable types. The absence of horses, and other
of the more useful domestic animals, was also a disadvantage.
</p>

<p>
After reading of the Europeans of that day it is
irony to call the Americans revengeful or cruel. Where
is it possible to find more strongly developed those
qualities which civilization most condemns than among
civilized nations—the same, only refined? So blind
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_64' href='#Page_64'>64</a></span>
are we to our own faults, so quick to see and condemn
the faults of our weak and defenceless neighbor!
</p>

<p>
Catalogue crime and place the white beside the
red. Seldom was the Indian treacherous until he
had been deceived. The Indians tortured their prisoners;
so did the white men, hunting them with
bloodhounds, enslaving them, branding them with hot
irons, beating and roasting them, making them work
in the mines until death relieved them by thousands,
butchering wives and children because the husband
and father dared strike a blow in their defence. It is
well to call them brutal in warfare when the white
man so quickly adopts their most brutal customs; it
is well to call them beasts of prey, when the white
man crosses the ocean to prey upon those very beasts
which he pretends to slur.
</p>

<p>
In speaking of the Indians, it has become the
custom wilfully to misapply terms. If a tribe resist
an injury, it is called an outbreak; if successful in
war, it is a massacre; if successful in single combat, it
is a murder. Thus soldiers speak to cover the disgrace
of defeat, and thus reports are made by men
who regard not decency in speaking of a savage, to
say nothing of fairness. It is enough that we have
exterminated this people, without attempting to malign
them and exalt our own baseness. What should
we do were a foreign power to come in ships to our
shore and begin to slaughter our animals, to stake
off our land and divide it among themselves? We
should drive them away if we were able; but if we
found them the stronger, we should employ every art
to destroy them, and in so doing regard ourselves as
patriots performing a sacred obligation. This is the
Indians crime; and in so doing we call him cunning,
revengeful, hateful, diabolical. But the white man
brings him blankets, it may be said, brings him medicine,
tells him of contrivances, teaches him civilization.
These things are exactly what the savage does
not want, and what he is much better off without.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_65' href='#Page_65'>65</a></span>
The white man's comforts kill him almost as quickly
as do his cruelties; and the teachings of Christ's
ministers are abhorrent if they are coupled with the
examples of lecherous and murderous professors of
Christianity.
</p>

<p>
These, however, were by no means all that white
men gave the Indian. We might enumerate alcohol,
small-pox, measles, syphilis, and a dozen other disgusting
adjuncts of civilization of which the savage
before knew nothing. Can savagism boast greater
achievements? White men have killed fifty Indians
where Indians have killed one white man, and this,
notwithstanding that nine tenths of all injuries inflicted
have been perpetrated by white invaders.
A thousand Indian women have been outraged by
men whose mothers had taught them the Lord's
prayer, where one white woman has been injured by
these benighted heathen. At any time in the history
of America I would rather take my chances as a
white woman among savages, than as an Indian
woman among white people.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">SIGNIFICATIONS OF PROGRESS.</div>

<p>
Brethren by procreation, but by destiny foes,
as we behold them there the so-called New and
Old thus so strangely brought together, naturally
enough we ask ourselves, Whence came the one, and
whither tends the other? Whence came these dusky
denizens of the forest, and for how many thousands
of ages has the feeble light of their intelligence struggled
with the darkness, dimly flickering, now gathering
strength, now falling back into dense obscurity;
how long and in what manner has the divine spark thus
wrestled with its environment? And whither tends
this fierce flame of human advancement which just
now bursts its ancient boundaries, sweeps across the
Sea of Darkness, absorbs all lesser lights, and dazzles
and consumes a hemisphere of souls? More especially,
when we look back toward what we are accustomed
to call the beginning, and mark the steady
advance of knowledge, the ever-increasing power of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_66' href='#Page_66'>66</a></span>
mind; when we consider the progress of even the last
half century, and listen to the present din and clatter
of improvement, do we raise our eyes to the future
and ask, Whither tends all this? Whither tends with
so rapidly accelerating swiftness this self-begetting
of enlightenment, this massing of human acquirements;
whither tends this perpetually increasing domination
of the intellectual over the material? Within
the past few thousand years we have seen our race
emerge from barbarism, and notwithstanding the inherent
tendency to evil ever present in our natures,
we have seen mankind put on civilization and accept
for their faith Christianity, the purest and highest type
of religion. We have seen nations cease somewhat
their hereditary growlings, and brutal blood-sheddings,
and mingle as brethren; we have seen wavy grain
supplant the tangled wildwood, gardens materialize
from the mirage, and magnificent cities rise out of
the rocky ground. Thus we have seen the whole
earth placed under tribute, and this mysterious reasoning
intelligence of ours elevating itself yet more
and more above the instincts of the brute, and asserting
its dominion over nature; belting the earth with
an impatient energy, which now presses outward
from every meridian, widening its domain as best it
may toward the north and toward the south, building
equatorial fires under polar icebergs. All this
and more from the records of our race we have seen
accomplished, and yet do see it; civilization working
itself out in accordance with the eternal purposes of
Omnipotence, unfolding under man's agency, yet independent
of man's will; a subtile, extraneous, unifying
energy, stimulated by agencies good not more
than by agencies evil, yet always tending in its results
to good rather than to evil; an influence beyond
the reach or cognizance of man, working in and round
persons and societies, turning and overturning, now
clouding the sky with blackness and dropping disorder
on floundering humanity, but only to be
followed by a yet more fertilizing sunshine; laying
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_67' href='#Page_67'>67</a></span>
waste and building up, building up by laying waste,
civilizing as well by war and avarice as by good-will
and sweet charity, civilizing as surely, if not as rapidly,
with the world of humanity struggling against
it, as with the same human world laboring for it.
</p>

<p>
Slowly rattles along the dim present, well-nigh
buried in its own dust; it is only the past that is well-defined
and clear to history.
</p>

<h3>
<span class="smcap">Summary of Geographical Knowledge and Discovery from the
Earliest Records to the Year 1540.</span>
</h3>

<p class="blockquot">
Before entering upon the narration of events composing this history, it
seems to me important, in order as well properly to appreciate the foregoing
Introduction as to gain from succeeding chapters something more than
gratified curiosity, that an exposition of Early Voyages should be given,—acting
powerfully as they did on evolving thought and material development,
giving breadth and vigor to intellect, enthusiasm to enterprise, and in
elevating and stimulating that commercial spirit which was eventually to
depose kings, exalt the people, strip from science its superstitions, from religion
its cabalistic forms, and by its associations, its negotiations, its adventurous
daring, its wars, its alliances, and its humanizing polities, to break
the barriers of ancient enmity and bring together in common brotherhood
all the nations of the earth.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
Therefore, I now propose to give a chronological statement of every authentic
voyage of discovery made beyond the Mediterranean prior to 1540,
while doubtful and disputed voyages will be discussed according to their
relative importance. I shall notice, moreover, such books and charts relating
to America as were produced during this period, with fac-similes of the
more important maps, to illustrate, at different dates, the progress of discovery.
It is my purpose, so far as possible, in the very limited space allowed, to state
fairly the conclusions of the best writers on every important point.
</p>

<p class="p2 blockquot">
One word as to the authorities consulted in the preparation of this Summary.
Of books relating to America, published prior to 1540, there are
in all about sixty-five; only twenty-five, however, contain original information;
twenty-three are general cosmographical works with brief sections on
America compiled from the original twenty-five; while seventeen merely
mention the New World or its discoveries, and are therefore of no value in
this connection. Of the forty-eight containing matter more or less important,
there are over two hundred editions, the earliest of which only, in most
instances, will be mentioned, and that without extensive bibliographical
notes. These books and charts I notice in chronological order under dates
of their successive appearance.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
The subject of Early Voyages has been so frequently and so thoroughly
discussed by able modern writers that it is unnecessary, and indeed impracticable
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_68' href='#Page_68'>68</a></span>
in so condensed an essay, to refer to ancient authorities alone,
and prove everything from the beginning. I shall therefore, besides the
Spanish historians Peter Martyr, Oviedo, Las Casas, Gomara, Herrera, and
the standard collections of Ramusio, Grynæus, Purchas, and Hakluyt, freely
use the works of later writers according to their relative worth. And of
these last mentioned I epitomize the following. <i>Historia del Nuevo-Mundo,
escribíala D. Juan Baut. Muñoz</i>, tom. i.—all ever published—<i>En Madrid</i>,
1793, contains a clear well-written <i>prologo</i>, or essay, on the first three voyages
of Columbus with minor mention of contemporary discoveries. An account
is also given of the author's labors in beginning the large and invaluable
collection of documents completed and published by Martin Fernandez de
Navarrete, <i>Coleccion de los Viages y Descubrimientos que hicieron por mar los
Españoles desde fines del siglo XV.</i>, 5 vols. 4to, Madrid, 1825-37. This
collection of Navarrete's is without doubt the most valuable work on
the subject of early American voyages, and the foundation of all that
followed; containing as it does the original Spanish, Latin, and Portuguese
texts of the more important Spanish and Portuguese expeditions from
1393 to 1540—the Latin and Portuguese done into Spanish—together with
over five hundred original documents from the Spanish archives, with extensive
and generally impartial notes by the editor. For a biographical
sketch of this author see <a href="#Page_183">chapter iii. of this volume</a>. Washington Irving's
<i>Life and Voyages of Christopher Columbus and his Companions</i>, published in
London, 1828-31 (edition used, that of New York, 1869, 3 vols.), is an able
and elegant abridged translation of Navarrete, and of <i>La Historia de el
Almirante D. Christoval Colon</i>, by his son Fernando Colon, in <i>Barcia</i>, <i>Historiadores
Primitivos</i>, tom. i., Madrid, 1749. Alexander von Humboldt's <i>Examen
critique de l'histoire de la Géographie du nouveau continent, et des progrès
de l'astronomie nautique aux 15ème et 16ème Siècles</i>, 5 vols. 8vo, Paris, 1836-9,
is a most exhaustive digest of materials furnished by Navarrete and the older
historians, illustrated with the results of the author's personal investigations.
The work embraces two treatises; first, the causes which led to the discovery
of America; second, facts relating to Columbus and Vespucci, with the
dates of geographic discoveries. Humboldt's <i>Abhandlung über die ältesten
Karten</i>, printed as an introduction to <i>Ghillany</i>, <i>Geschichte des Seefahrers Ritter
Martin Behaim</i>, Nuremberg, 1853, of which I have only a manuscript English
translation, is an essay as well on the naming of America as on early maps.
Another important treatise is that of J. G. Kohl, <i>Die beiden ältesten General-Karten
von America</i>, Weimar, 1860, of nearly two hundred large folio pages
on the earliest manuscript and printed maps, two of the former, dated 1527
and 1529, accompanying the work, reproduced in chromo-lithographic fac-simile.
The same author has produced other works on the subject, the most
important being <i>A History of the Discovery of the East Coast of North America,
published in Collections of the Maine Historical Society</i>, 2d series, vol. i.,
Portland, 1869. This contains reduced copies of twenty-three early maps,
and is perhaps the most complete work existing, so far as the northern coasts
are concerned, giving comparatively little attention to more southern voyages.
<i>Kunstmann</i>, <i>Die Entdeckung Amerikas</i>, Munich, 1859, is a careful
compilation of ninety-six imperial quarto pages, with copious notes and references,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_69' href='#Page_69'>69</a></span>
written to accompany a collection of thirteen large chromo-lithographic
reproductions of manuscript maps preserved in the Academy of Sciences at
Munich, and generally known as the <i>Munich Atlas</i>. Herr Kunstmann treats
chiefly of the Atlantic islands, with special reference to the connection between
the discoveries of Spaniards and Northmen. <i>Major's Life of Prince
Henry of Portugal</i>, London, 1868, is the best authority for Portuguese voyages
as well as for the revival of maritime enterprise in the fifteenth century.
<i>Stevens' Historical and Geographical Notes on the Earliest Discoveries in America,
1453-1530</i>, New Haven, 1869, was written originally as an introduction
to a book by the author's brother on his proposed interoceanic communication
via Tehuantepec. It is a concise statement of the whole matter, presenting
some of its phases in a practically new light. <i>Varnhagen</i>, <i>Le Premier
Voyage de Amerigo Vespucci</i>, Vienna, 1869, must not be omitted as the chief
support of a theory on Vespucci's voyages which nearly concerns the first
discovery of our Pacific States territory proper. <i>Rafn</i>, <i>Antiquitates Americanæ</i>,
Hafniæ, 1837, is the source of nearly all our knowledge of the discoveries
of the Northmen in America in the tenth and following centuries; and
<i>De Costa</i>, <i>The Pre-Columbian Discovery of America</i>, Albany, 1868, presents
an English translation of the same Icelandic <i>sagas</i> in which the enterprises
of the Northmen are recorded. The <i>Cartografía Mexicana</i> of Orozco y Berra,
published by the Mexican Geographical Society, contains, as its title indicates,
a mention of early maps in chronologic order; and the <i>Mapoteca Colombiana</i>
of Urricœchea, London, 1860, is another important contribution of
similar nature. There should be mentioned the excellent review given in
the first volume of <i>Bryant's History of the United States</i>, which has appeared
since this Summary was written; and I might present quite a list of papers
read before the various learned societies of Europe and America on different
topics connected with this subject in late years, none of them I believe
materially affecting my conclusions.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
The above form but a small portion of the works devoted wholly or in part
to the subject, but they are believed to contain all the material necessary for
even a more detailed statement than my purpose demands.

<div class="sidenote">ADVENTURES OF THE ANCIENTS.</div>

<p class="p2 blockquot">
Of the voyages of the ancients, properly so called, that is, of such as preceded
the fall of the Roman Empire at the end of the fourth century, I shall
here say little. These maritime expeditions, confined for the most part to
the Mediterranean, though extending for some distance along the coasts of the
Indian and Atlantic oceans, with occasional voyages designedly or accidentally
prolonged to more distant islands, and it may be continents, come down
to us through antique histories, cosmographies, and poems, so mixed with
vague hypothetical and mythological conceptions, that the most searching investigation
is often unable to separate fact from fable. There are multitudes
of classic and mediæval legends adopted by Tasso, Pulci, and other Italian
poets, such, for example, as that which makes the Greek wanderer Ulysses
the pioneer of western adventure, which in a sober treatise are scarcely
worthy of mention. Turning to the dawn his vessel's poop, this son of
Laertes, it is said, passed Gibraltar, the bound ordained by Hercules not to
be overstepped by man, and, as Dante tells us, sailed for the Happy Isles of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_70' href='#Page_70'>70</a></span>
the unknown Atlantic, unrestrained by son, or father, or even Penelope's
ever-weaving web of love.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
A little journey was a wonderful exploit before the time of Christ—instance
the immortal fame achieved by Hanno, the Carthaginian, in visiting
the west coast of Africa, <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 570; by Herodotus, in making the excursion
of Egypt and India, <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 464-456; by Pytheas, in his voyage to the British
Isles, <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 340; by Nearchus, in descending the Indus, <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 326; by Eudoxus,
in his attempt to sail round Africa, <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 130; by Cæsar, in undertaking the
conquest of Gaul, <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> 58; by Strabo, in penetrating Asia some thirty or forty
years later. After the Christian era Pausanias, a Roman, in 175 wrote a
guide-book of Greece; Fa Hian, a Chinese monk, went westward into India
in the year 400 or thereabout; Cosmas Indicopleustes travelled in India a
century and a half later and wrote a book to prove the world square, and
the universe an oblong coffer; Arculphe wrote of the Holy Land about 650;
an Englishman, Willibald, made the tour of southern Europe and Palestine,
setting out from Southampton in 721; in 851 went Soliman from Persia to
the China sea. So it has been said.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
Indeed, the writings of Herodotus indicate that, over two thousand years
before Dias and Vasco da Gama, Africa was circumnavigated by a fleet of
Phœnician ships sent by Pharaoh Necho down the Red Sea with orders to
return to Egypt by way of the Pillars of Hercules. A Persian, Sataspes,
endeavored to accomplish the voyage from the other direction, but failed.
Plato's island of Atlantis, founded by the god Neptune, was of great size,
"larger than Asia and Libya together, and was situated over against the
straits now called the Pillars of Hercules." The climate and soil were so
good that fruits ripened twice every year. There were metals, with elephants
and other animals in abundance. Upon a mountain was a beautiful city
with gold and ivory palaces, having gardens and statues. Unfortunately in
time the sea swallowed up this island, so that it could scarcely have been
America.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PROPHECY OF QUETZALCOATL.</div>

<p class="blockquot">
So far as these voyages and strange tales concern the possible knowledge of
America by the ancients, I have already discussed them in my <i><a href="#Native_Races">Native Races of the Pacific States</a></i>. Therein is mentioned a theory which has found many
advocates, and to which I will again briefly allude in this place. It is that
at the beginning of the Christian era America was visited by the Apostle
St Thomas. He was accompanied by a number of fellow-laborers in the
ministry, who preached the gospel and planted the Christian religion in
America. The theory is ably advocated in the excellent work of Rev. W.
Gleeson, <i>The History of the Catholic Church in California</i>. The principal
arguments advanced may be briefly stated as follows: First, that the whole
tenor of Scripture teaching is in favor of the supposition that the gospel was
preached to all the world from the beginning, rather than after the lapse of
several centuries. Second, that at a date fixed by Mexican hieroglyphics
as a little before the middle of the first century after Christ, a celebrated
personage, certainly the most remarkable in Mexican mythology, came from
the north. He is represented as a white man, with flowing beard, clad in a
long white robe, adorned with red crosses, head uncovered, and a staff in his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_71' href='#Page_71'>71</a></span>
hand. This was the Quetzalcoatl, whom the Mexicans afterward worshipped,
and whose return was so anxiously looked for by them. See <i>Torquemada</i>,
<i>Monarq. Ind.</i> Third, that to him popular tradition ascribes the worship paid
to the cross, the practice of confession, and in a word all the customs found
on the arrival of the Spaniards to be nearly identical with those of the Christian
religion. <i>Veytia</i>, <i>Hist. Ant. de Mexico</i>. Fourth, that the name Quetzalcoatl
is synonymous with that of St Thomas. See <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/45268/45268-h/45268-h.htm"><i>Native Races</i>, v. 26</a>. Fifth,
that Quetzalcoatl promised on his departure to return at some future day
with his posterity and resume the possession of the empire, and that day was
looked forward to with general confidence, <i>Prescott's Conq. Mex.</i>, and that a
general feeling prevailed at the time of Montezuma that the period of his
return had arrived. <i>Veytia</i>, <i>Hist. Ant. Mex.</i> Sixth, that there were at the
convent of Nijapa, in the province of Oajaca, hieroglyphs containing all the
principal doctrines of the Christian religion, and the coming of the Apostle
to the country. <i>Id.</i>
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
Sahagun, who wrote at the time of the conquest, speaks of the general
belief in this prophecy, and assures us that on the arrival of the Spaniards
they repeatedly offered them divine honors, believing that their god Quetzalcoatl
had returned. <i>Conq. Mex.</i>, i. chap. iii.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"It is then undeniably true," says Gleeson, <i>Catholic Church in Cal.</i>, 185,
"that a popular tradition existed in the country respecting a prophecy made
by Quetzalcohuatl, in which was foretold the future arrival of whites on the
coast; and this, while it proves the reality of the man, and his character as
a teacher of religion, also proves the still more important and appreciable
fact of his being a Christian, and of western origin; for, it was clearly set
forth in the prophecy, that the persons who should come would be whites,
and of the same religion as he. The time also seems to have been specified
by the Apostle, if we are to judge by the expression that they were expecting
him every day. And, indeed, Boturini assures us that the time mentioned in
the Mexican hieroglyphics was that in which the Christians arrived. The
year <i>ce acatl</i> was that foretold by Quetzalcohuatl, and in that year the Spaniards
landed in the Country." On ancient voyages and cosmography see also
Humboldt, <i>Exam. Crit.</i>, tom. i. pp. 125-206.

<p class="blockquot">
It is the results of ancient voyages, the point of geographical knowledge
attained by ancient civilization in its most advanced stage and by it bequeathed
to the Dark Age, and not the voyages themselves, with which we
have to do at present. This knowledge is found for the most part embodied
in the system of Ptolemy, the Alexandrian geographer of the second century,
whose works became the standard text-books, and holding their prominence
for fourteen hundred years were not superseded as late as the sixteenth
century, but were republished from time to time, with additions, setting forth
the results of new discoveries. In this manner twenty-one editions appeared
during the first half of that century. Nor was even Ptolemy the originator
of this prolonged system. One hundred and fifty years before him was the
Greek geographer Strabo, who gave descriptions of countries and peoples,
fixing his localities usually by itinerary distances; and to this work of
Strabo's, Ptolemy added a century and a half of progress, and determined
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_72' href='#Page_72'>72</a></span>
his localities by astronomical observation. The work of Pomponius Mela,
the Roman geographer who wrote probably somewhat later than Strabo, is
regarded as no improvement on that of his predecessor.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
Ptolemy's World was nearly all in the north temperate zone, embracing
about fifty degrees of latitude and one hundred and twenty of longitude.
The Fortunate Isles, now called the Canaries, were known to Ptolemy, and
by him used as a western limit or first meridian. This, and as a nucleus of
poetic myths, seem to have been their only use; as Muñoz says, <i>Hist. del
Nuevo Mundo</i>, p. 30: "Fuera de este uso apenas aprovecharon sino para
entretenir ociosas imaginaciones con fábulas de poetas." The eastern limit
was vaguely located in the region beyond the Ganges; actually in about 100°
east longitude. On the south were included the African coasts of the Mediterranean
and Red Sea, with the southern coasts of Arabia and India
proper—the term India being then applied indefinitely to all eastern lands,
including even parts of Africa—thus fixing the southern bound at about 30°
north latitude in the west, and 10° in the east. Northward the limit may be
placed a little above 60°, within which falls the southern part of the Scandinavian
peninsula, then supposed to be an island, and also the island of Thule,
the location of which is disputed, some claiming it to have been Iceland,
others the Faroe Islands, and others the Shetland Islands. But Ptolemy's
latitudes were all some ten degrees too far north, while in his longitudes he
went still further astray; since, reckoning from the Canaries as his first
meridian, he made his last meridian 180°, when it should have been 120°, and
thus by narrowing half the circumference of the globe some sixty degrees he
made the world nearly one third less than it really is. Authorities differ,
however, as to what were Ptolemy's ideas. But more of this hereafter. On
the opposite page is a map in which the world as known in these times is left
white, the shaded portions being the result of subsequent discoveries down
to the last half of the fifteenth century. A map of Ptolemy's World, reduced
to its true proportions, may be seen in <i>Goselin</i>, <i>Recherches sur la
géographie systématique et positive des anciens</i>, tom. iv., Paris, 1813.

<p class="blockquot">
Within these limits, then, geographical knowledge was confined at the
end of the fourth century; limits not sharply defined, but indefinite and
wavering according to ages, to the directions of conquest, and to distances
from Mediterranean centres. Beyond these limits was a realm of darkness
peopled by strange beings, creatures of poetic fancy or crude conjecture. Just
as the wonder-land of Homer to contemporaneous eastern Greeks, was Italy,
with its strange waters inhabited by very strange beasts, and Sicily, and
neighboring isles, where were the Satyrs, and the gigantic one-eyed Cyclops
eating milk and mutton and men, so to later teachers were the strange seas
beyond. On the north was an impenetrable region of eternal ice; on the
south, an equatorial zone of burning heat; a barrier of frost on the one side
and of fire on the other, both equally uninhabitable to the European man,
and cutting off all communication with possible habitable lands elsewhere.
The burning zone, however, seems to have been a popular idea, rather than a
part of the system taught by Ptolemy, who, indeed, held that Africa extended
south-east and north-east toward the eastern parts of Asia, making of
the Indian Ocean an immense gulf not connected with the Atlantic on the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_74' href='#Page_74'>74</a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_73' href='#Page_73'></a></span>
west. Strabo and other geographers who preceded Ptolemy gave Africa
approximately its correct shape; traditions of its circumnavigation even were
kept alive, in spite of Ptolemy's theory, influencing geographic thought not
a little during the fifteenth century. Irving is of opinion, <i>Columbus</i>, vol.
iii. p. 440, that modern authors consider the knowledge of the ancients concerning
Africa much less extensive than has been generally supposed; but
Major, <i>Prince Henry</i>, p. 89 et seq., accepts a circumnavigation of Africa in
the seventh century <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>, and also Hanno's voyage far down the African
coast, placing the date of the latter 570 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> Among the philosophers of
western Europe no definite hypotheses appear to have been advanced as to
the extent of land beyond the known region; as to the ideas of the Arabs
and Buddhist priests concerning the matter it is difficult to determine. See
<i>Kohl's Hist. Discov.</i>, p. 149;
<i>Draper's Intellectual Development</i>, p. 451, New
York, 1872. Beyond the Fortunate Isles to the west stretched a <i>Mare
Tenebrosum</i>, or Sea of Darkness, as early writers express it, separating the
known western coast from the far unknown east. In this dark sea tradition
planted islands at various points, reiterating the fact of their existence so
often that names and locations were finally given them on maps, though the
islands themselves have never yet been found. Except these fabulous
islands, there was little thought of land between the coasts of Europe and
Asia. Compare maps in this volume; also <i>George Bancroft's History of the
United States</i>, vol. i. p. 6, Boston, 1870;
<i>D'Avesac</i>, in <i>Nouvelles Annales des
Voyages</i>, 1845, tom. cv. p. 293; tom. cvi. p. 47.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
To sum up the geographical knowledge of the ancients, we have first, the
sphericity of the earth surmised, although its size was vaguely conceived and
underrated; secondly, the positive knowledge of Europeans limited to the
unshaded portion of <a href="#i-147">the map on page 73</a>; thirdly, divers theories respecting
the conformation of southern Africa; fourthly, a <i>mare oceanum</i> stretching
westward to the unknown Asiatic shore, with hypothetical islands intervening,
and expressed opinions that this sea was navigable, and that possibly
India might be reached by sailing westward. These ideas, vague as they
seem, were held only by the learned few; the world of the ignorant reached
scarcely beyond the horizon of their actual experience. Not until long after
its actual circumnavigation, in the sixteenth century, was the popular mind
able to grasp the idea of the earth's sphericity.
</p>

<p class="p2 blockquot">
We come now to mediæval times, when from the fifth to the fifteenth century
the cosmographical as well as all other knowledge of the ancients lay
well-nigh dormant; to the people a land of darkness as well as a sea, though
in some few colleges and convents these things were thought of. "Ces ténèbres,"
says Humboldt, <i>Exam. Crit.</i>, tom. i. p. 59, "s'étendaient sans doute
sur les masses; mais, dans les couvens et les colléges quelques individus conservaient
les traditions de l'antiquité." Upon this world of darkness light
first broke from the far north, the voyages of the Scandinavians from the
ninth to the twelfth centuries being the <i>aurora borealis</i> of maritime discovery.
These Northmen, as in their expeditions Danes, Norwegians, and
Swedes were indiscriminately called, by their warlike propensities made
themselves known and feared along the shores of Europe at an early date;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_75' href='#Page_75'>75</a></span>
but their western discoveries were known only to themselves; at all events, no
trace of distant voyages to the west are found in the records of their neighbors.
It is only quite recently that the sagas of the Northmen were brought
to the attention of European scholars; and when the Danish bishop,
Müller, published his bibliography of the sagas, 3 vols., Copenhagen, 1817-1820,
these narratives were held to be more fiction than fact. Even so late a
writer as George Bancroft, <i>History of the United States</i>, vol. i. pp. 5, 6, says
that the story of colonization by the Northmen "rests on narratives, mythological
in form, and obscure in meaning; ancient, yet not contemporary," and
that "no clear historic evidence establishes the natural probability that they
accomplished the passage." Irving, <i>Columbus</i>, vol. iii. pp. 432-5, considers
the matter "still to be wrapped in much doubt and obscurity." Both of these
authors, however, seem to have considered only the evidence presented by
Malte-Brun and Forster. Since their time proofs beyond question have
established the authenticity of these voyages of the Northmen. The sagas
on American discoveries are preserved in the archives at Copenhagen, with a
collection of other historical data, reaching down to the fourteenth century,
the date of their completion. It is true that they deal somewhat in the
marvellous—they would not be authentic else, written at that time—but
they contain tales no more wonderful or monstrous than the writings of more
southern nations. See an account of the Copenhagen documents and the
examination of their authenticity in <i>De Costa's Pre-Columbian Discov. Am.</i>,
pp. i-lx. Two nearly contemporary ecclesiastical histories—that of Adam of
Bremen, 1073, and Ordericus Vitalis, about 1100—describe briefly the western
lands of the Northmen. Further reference, <i>Kunstmann</i>, <i>Entdeckung Am.</i>, p.
32;

<div class="sidenote">THE NORTHMEN AND THEIR SAGAS.</div>

<p class="p2 blockquot">
Vague notions were not wanting of communication with America before
the time of the Northmen, but these, whatever they were, are now to us pure
speculation and may be omitted here. Passing over a general movement by
which before the middle of the ninth century the Northmen appear to have
broken through their former bounds, and to have extended their plundering
raids in all directions, taking possession of the Shetland and Faroe islands
and even of the north of Britain, we come to the first definite adventure
westward.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
[<span class="smcap">a. d.</span> 860-4.] Two bold men, Naddod and Gardar, in one of their coast-island
cruises, were driven from their course to the north-west and discovered
Iceland, called by one Snowland, and by the other Gardar Island. Kohl,
<i>Hist. Discov.</i>, p. 61, dates both voyages 860; Forster gives 861 to Naddod's;
other authors place the former in the year 860, and the latter in 864.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
[874.] Ingolf made a settlement in Iceland at a point still called by his
name. Other immigrants followed, and a flourishing colony was founded.
The Northmen found on the island Irish priests, who had come there at a
time not definitely known, but who immediately abandoned the country to
the new settlers. Within twenty years thereafter Iceland was fairly well
inhabited. De Costa, <i>Pre-Columbian Discov. Am.</i>, pp. xxii-iv., makes the
date <span class="smcap">a. d.</span> 875.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
[876.] One Gunnbjörn, an Icelandic colonist, is reported to have seen accidentally,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_76' href='#Page_76'>76</a></span>
from a distance, the coast of Greenland. Kohl dates this voyage
877.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
[982-6.] Eric the Red, banished from Iceland for murder in 982, sailed
west, found land, remained there three years, and returned, naming the
country Greenland to attract settlers. In 985, or 986, he sailed again with a
larger force, this time founding a settlement to which other adventurers resorted.
Of the first voyage Kohl makes no mention.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
[983.] One of the sagas contains a report by an Irish merchant that one
Are Marson was carried in a storm to Whiteman's Land "in the Western
Ocean, opposite Vinland, six days' sail west of Ireland." Rafn thinks this
may have been that part of America in the vicinity of Florida; others make
it the Azores. There are also vague reports of later voyages to the same
land by Björn Asbrandson in 999, and by Gudleif in 1027. In the present
stage of investigation the proof is insufficient to establish an Irish pre-Scandinavian
discovery of America.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
[990.] In this year, or, as De Costa makes it, in 986, Biarne, sailing from
Iceland in search of his father, who had previously gone to Greenland, was
carried far to the south-west, to within sight of land, undoubtedly America,
which he coasted north-east for several days and returned to Greenland.
Three points particularly noticed on the new coast are conjectured by Kohl
to have been Cape Cod, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
[1000.] Leif, son of Eric the Red, sailed from Greenland south-west in
search of the lands seen by Biarne, reached the same in reverse order, landing
probably at Newfoundland, which he named Helluland (Stony Land);
Nova Scotia, he called Markland (Woodland); and passing round Cape Cod,
made a settlement, named after himself, Leifsbudir, at some point on Narragansett
Bay. He called this country Vinland from the fact that vines were
found there, and the name was afterwards applied to the whole region extending
northward to Markland. In the spring of 1001 Leif returned to
Greenland with a cargo of grapes and wood.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
[1002-5.] Thorwald, another of Eric's sons, sailed with one vessel to Vinland,
where Leif had landed, and lived there through the winter by fishing.
Early in 1003 he explored the country westward in boats, and in the spring
of 1004 doubled Cape Cod, naming it Kialarnes (Ship's Nose), and perished
in a battle with the Skraellings, or Indians, at some point on the shore of
Massachusetts Bay. His companions spent the winter at Leifsbudir and returned
to Greenland in 1005.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
[1008.] In the spring of 1008 Thorfinn Karlsefne sailed from Greenland
with three vessels to Helluland—which name was applied not only to Newfoundland
but to the region north of that point—and thence along the coast
to Nova Scotia, and to Cape Cod. Here the party divided, Thorhall, the
hunter, in attempting to explore northward, being driven by a storm to
Ireland, while Thorfinn spent the winter farther south near Leifsbudir, where
a son was born to him. After an unsuccessful search for Thorhall by one
vessel, a third winter was spent in Vinland, and in 1011 Thorfinn returned
to Greenland, leaving perhaps a small colony. De Costa, <i>Pre-Columbian
Discov. Am.</i>, pp. 48-76, makes the date of this voyage 1007-10.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
[1012.] Helge, Finboge, and Eric's daughter Freydisa, who had before
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_77' href='#Page_77'>77</a></span>
visited America with her husband, sailed to Vinland, and such as were not
killed in the internal dissensions of the party returned to Greenland in 1013.
The records of this expedition are very slight. De Costa's date is 1011-12.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
[1035.] Adam of Bremen speaks of Frisian or German navigators who
about the year 1035 landed on an island beyond Iceland, where the inhabitants
were of great size, and were accompanied by fierce dogs—perhaps the
Eskimos.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
[1121.] After the expeditions that have been mentioned, concerning each
of which the sagas contain one or more accounts, no farther regular reports
have been preserved; but various voyages are briefly alluded to in different
records, as though trips to the new regions of Vinland were no longer of
sufficient rarity to be specially noticed. Such allusions refer to voyages
made in 1121, 1285, 1288, 1289, 1290, and 1357. After 1357 no more is heard
of the western lands. The settlements were gradually abandoned both in
Vinland and Greenland, as the power of the Northmen declined, and so far
as can be known, even their memory was buried in the unread records of
former greatness. On Scandinavian discoveries, besides Rafn and De Costa,

<div class="sidenote">DECLINE OF SCANDINAVIAN DISCOVERY.</div>

<p class="blockquot">
Thus after this play of northern lights upon the western horizon for four or
five centuries, enterprise in that direction languished, and finally the Sea
of Darkness lapsed into its primeval obscurity. Nevertheless the deeds of the
Scandinavians must have become more or less known to other parts of Europe,
for the spirit of uneasiness which sent these Northmen across their western
waters sent them also—particularly the Danes—eastward in the Holy
Crusades. It would be well for the student to examine the works of Adam
of Bremen, and Ordericus Vitalis, who beside these pre-Columbian voyages
describe also the Crusades. Moreover, Iceland had Catholic bishops and was
therefore in communication with Rome, where the discoveries of the Northmen
must have been known. Rafn, <i>Antiquitates Am.</i>, pp. 283, 292, and
De Costa, <i>Pre-Columbian Discov. Am.</i>, pp. 106-109, give translations from
Scandinavian archives of contemporaneous descriptions of the earth in
which these New World discoveries of the Northmen are included. Sailing
charts and maps of the new discoveries must have been drawn by the Northmen,
for although none of them were preserved, yet in <i>Torfæus</i>, <i>Grœnlandia
antiqua</i>, Hauniæ, 1706, made by Icelandic draughtsmen in the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries, and in Ptolemy's Geography, edition of 1482, is information
of certain things contained in no other charts of the period extant,
which must therefore have been partially compiled from Scandinavian sources.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
It is not to be supposed that the Northmen imagined that they had found
a new continent; very naturally to them Greenland, Helluland, Markland,
and Vinland were but the western continuation of Europe. It is to this
belief, as well as to the prevailing apathy and skepticism of the age concerning
matters beyond the reach of positive knowledge, that the strange fact of
the loss of all trace of these discoveries is due.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
The exact results of these ancient expeditions, and their influence on the
subsequent revival of maritime enterprise, form a difficult and as yet undecided
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_78' href='#Page_78'>78</a></span>
point in the discussion of this subject. Kunstmann gives particular
attention to this matter, and attaches more importance to northern voyages
and their connection with later expeditions than most other authors; still it
has not yet been proved that Prince Henry, Toscanelli, or Columbus in the
fifteenth century had any knowledge of north-western discoveries.
</p>

<p class="p2 blockquot">
[1096-1271.] The Crusades—as expeditions, but chiefly for their results—deserve
a brief mention in this connection. When in the seventh century
Palestine passed from Christian to Mahometan hands, in which possession it
has remained with but temporary interruptions to the present time, Christian
pilgrimages to the Holy City for a few centuries were allowed, and to some
extent protected. By successive changes of dynasty, however, power was
transferred from the Arab to the Turkish branch of the Mahometans, so
that in the eleventh century Christian pilgrims were cruelly oppressed,
and hindered from their pious visits to the tomb of Christ. Roused at first
by the exhortations of Peter the Hermit, Italy, France, England, and
Germany sent armies of the undisciplined and fanatical rabble to avenge
the insults to their faith, and wrest the Holy City from the power of barbarian
heretics. From the eleventh to the thirteenth century nine expeditions
were undertaken eastward in the prosecution of this work. Jerusalem
was several times taken and retaken, but finally the Crescent was successful
in resisting the encroachments of the Cross, and the Crusades failed in their
visionary purpose. Still the continued migration of vast multitudes, from
different nations through strange and distant lands, contributed much to increase
popular knowledge of the world, to arouse fresh interest in regions
hitherto little known, and to excite curiosity respecting the countries still
further to the east. Meanwhile, commerce received an impetus from the
work of furnishing supplies to the crusaders; so that these expeditions are
included by modern writers as prominent among the causes which led to
the coming revival of civilization.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
[1147.] During the twelfth century few maritime expeditions are reported
deserving of notice. At some not very clearly defined date before 1147, eight
Arabs, the Almagrurins, are said to have sailed thirty-five days south-west
from Lisbon with the intention of exploring the Sea of Darkness. At the
end of the thirty-five days they found and named an Isle of Sheep, and
twelve days farther south reached another island peopled by red men. They
are said to have found there a man who spoke Arabic. Upon the whole the
claim to a discovery of any part of America in this voyage should be slight.
If the voyage be authentic, the land reached was perhaps the Canary Islands;
some say those of Cape Verde.

[1160-73.] Benjamin de Tudela, a Spanish Jew, travelled for thirteen
years in India, bringing back considerable information respecting Chinese
Tartary and the islands of the Indian Ocean. <i>D. Benjamini</i>, <i>Itinerarium

[1170.] In this year is placed the reported voyage of Madoc, a Welsh
prince, who, sailing to the west and north from Ireland, landed on an unknown
shore. He afterward returned to this new country with ten ships
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_79' href='#Page_79'>79</a></span>
with the intention of colonizing, but was never again heard of. This voyage
rests on very slight authority, but has claimed importance by reason of reports,
long believed, of the existence in various parts of America of Welsh-speaking
Indian tribes. These reports, like scores of others referring the
Americans to European relationships, proved groundless. To say the least,
the voyage of Madoc must be considered doubtful. <i>The most ancient Discouery

<p class="blockquot">
[1246 et seq.] In the middle of the thirteenth century the desire to extend
Christianity was encouraged by rumored conversions already made in the dominions
of the Mogul, and especially by the report of a powerful Christian
monarch, Prester John, who had reigned somewhere in the interior of Asia.
This report led to the sending of several priests as missionaries to the far East.
Carpini in 1246, and Ascelino in 1254, Italian Franciscans, penetrated to
the region now known as Chinese Turkestan. About the same time, 1253
according to Hakluyt, Rubruquis, also a Franciscan, from Brabant, traversed
the central Asiatic deserts. He was the first to present a definite idea of the
position of Tartary and Cathay. A notice of his travels was given in the
writings of Roger Bacon in 1267. Toward the end of this century Odorico,
of the same order, visited Persia, India, and finally China, remaining three
years in Peking. <i>Viaggio del Beato Frate Odorico di Porto Maggiore del
Frivli fatto nell'Anno MCCCXVIII</i> (half a century later than above), in
<i>Ramusio</i>, tom. ii., fol. 254. See also <i>Hakluyt's Voy.</i>, vol. i. pp. 21-117; vol.

<div class="sidenote">VENETIAN AND GENOESE EXPEDITIONS.</div>

<p class="blockquot">
[1250-95.] Nicolo and Maffio Polo, Venetian brothers, left Venice in 1250
on a trading trip north-eastward. Passing north of the Caspian Sea, they
spent three years at Bokhara, and afterward in 1265, proceeded to the court
of Kublai Khan at Kemenfu in Chinese Tartary, whence they returned in
1269, intrusted with a mission to the Pope. In 1271 they again set out,
taking with them Marco, son of Nicolo. They revisited the Tartar court,
where they spent seventeen years, and returned by sea down the Chinese and
Indian coasts to Ormuz in Persia and thence overland to Constantinople,
reaching Venice in 1295. Marco seems to have been a great favorite at the
eastern court, where he was intrusted with missions in all directions. By
means of his own travels and by reports of the natives from all sections
whom he met, he gained an extensive knowledge of China and adjoining
countries, including the numerous islands of the coast, chief among which
was Zipangu, or Japan. From his memoranda, he afterwards wrote in
prison, a full account of his eastern travels, which was copied and widely
circulated in manuscript. See <i>Hakluyt Society</i>, <i>Divers Voyages</i>, Introd., p.
lii., London, 1850, for an account of printed editions of Polo's work. Its authenticity
and general reliability are now admitted, though doubtless errors
have been multiplied by copyists. This journey of Marco Polo was by far
the most important, for revising geography, of any undertaken during the
middle ages. From this time the coasts of Asia were laid down on maps
and described with tolerable accuracy by cosmographers. <i>De i Viaggi di
Messer Marco Polo, Gentil 'hvomo Venetiano</i>, in <i>Ramusio</i>, tom. ii. fol. 2-60;

The Venetians were the most enterprising navigators of the thirteenth and
fourteenth centuries. They reached England at an early date,—<i>Estancelin</i>,
<i>Recherches</i>, pp. 114-16, Paris, 1832—and not improbably extended their commercial
operations still farther north, Iceland being at the time a flourishing
republic with Catholic bishops. <i>Kohl's Hist. Discov.</i>, pp. 92-4. No details
however are preserved of any particular one of these voyages, nor of such as
may have been directed toward Cape Non, the southern limit of oceanic navigation.
Some time during this century a Moor, Ibn Fatimah, was driven by
storms from Cape Non down past Cape Blanco, and his adventure was recorded
in an Arabian geography.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
[1291.] Doria and Vivaldi, Genoese, undertook a voyage down the African
coast with a view of reaching India, and were last heard of at a place called
Gozora. On this voyage, which rests on several authorities, has been founded
a claim that the Italians preceded the Portuguese in passing Cape Bojador.
Major, <i>Prince Henry</i>, pp. 99-110, concludes from an examination of all the
documents that there are no grounds for this claim, although admitting the
voyage and its purpose, in fact everything but its success. Gozora was
probably Cape Non. Kohl regards this expedition as uncertain. One of the
documents gives the date as 1281; from which circumstance Kohl and Humboldt
erroneously make of it two voyages. D'Avesac, in <i>Nouvelles Annales
des Voyages</i>, 1845, tom. cviii. p. 45, has the date 1285. Muñoz, <i>Hist. Nuevo
Mundo</i>, pp. 30-1, speaks of Genoese expeditions and the rediscovery of the
Canaries during this century.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
[1306.] On a map made by the Venetian Sanuto in 1306, Africa is represented
as surrounded by the sea, but there is no evidence that the geography
of that region is derived from any actual observations. The map simply
shows one of the two theories then held respecting the shape of southern
Africa.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
[1332 et seq.] Sir John Mandeville, an English physician, between 1332
and 1366, travelled in eastern parts, including the Holy Land, India, and
China. On his return he wrote in three languages an account of his adventures,
with descriptions of the countries visited. See <i>Hakluyt Soc.</i>, <i>Divers
Voy.</i>, Introd. p. xliii. His work corroborates that of Marco Polo, and
although full of exaggerations, and probably tampered with by copyists in
respect to adventures and anecdotes, "yet," says Irving, "his accounts of
the countries which he visited have been found far more veracious than had
been imagined." <i>Purchas</i>, <i>His Pilgrimes</i>, vol. iii. pp. 128-38;
<i>Travels of Sir
John Mandeville</i>, London, 1725.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
[1341 et seq.] As we have seen, the Canaries were known to the ancients,
and made by Ptolemy the western limit of the world; but subsequently they
were nearly forgotten until rediscovered and visited, perhaps several times,
toward the middle of the fourteenth century, by the Portuguese. There
is a definite account of one of these voyages. Two vessels were sent there
by the King of Portugal in 1341, and nearly all the islands of the group
visited, but no settlement was made. Before this, Luis de la Cerda represented
to the Pope the existence of such islands, and received by a bull of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_81' href='#Page_81'>81</a></span>
lordship of them, with the title of Prince of Fortune. The king of
Portugal claimed in 1345 to have sent out previous expeditions to the islands.
The project of Cerda proved a failure and no colony was founded. Voyages
to the Canaries became quite frequent before the end of the century. <i>Galvano</i>,
<i>Discoveries</i>, London, 1862; and in <i>Collection of Curious Voyages</i>, London,
1812, p. 10;

<p class="blockquot">
[1346.] In August, 1346, Jaime Ferrer, a Catalan navigator, sailed from
Majorca in the Mediterranean to search down the African coast for the Rujaura,
or River of Gold, and never was heard from. This is proved by a document
in the Genoese archives, and by an inscription on a Catalan map
of 1375. Major shows this to have been an expedition in search of an unknown
or imaginary river of gold, whose supposed existence rested on ancient
traditions that a branch of the Nile flowed into the Atlantic, and which
belief was strengthened by the gold brought from Guinea by the Arabs.
Humboldt understands this Rujaura to have been the Rio d'Ouro below Cape
Bojador, an inlet named later by the Portuguese; and he also states that
Ferrer actually reached that point; but of this there seems to be no evidence.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
[1351 et seq.] The Azores appear to have been discovered by the Portuguese
early in this half century, appearing on a map of 1351. There is
however no account of the voyage by which this discovery was made, although
there is a tradition of a Greek who was there cast away in 1370. On
a Genoese map of the same date the Madeira group is shown, having probably
been discovered by Portuguese ships under Genoese captains early in the
fourteenth century.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
[1364.] By Villault de Bellefond, <i>Relation des costes d'Afrique</i>, Paris, 1669,
it is stated that the Dieppese in 1364 made a voyage round Cape Verde, and
far beyond, establishing trading-posts, which were repeatedly visited in the
following years. On this account, repeated by many writers—<i>Estancelin</i>,
<i>Recherches</i>, p. 72;
<i>Humboldt</i>, <i>Exam. Crit.</i>, tom. i. p. 285—is founded the
French claim of having preceded the Portuguese in passing Cape Bojador and
occupying the gold coast. Major, <i>Prince Henry</i>, pp. 117-33, maintains by
strong proofs that this voyage rests on no good authority, and that the French
occupation of that coast is of much later date.

<div class="sidenote">THE ZENI.</div>

<p class="blockquot">
[1380.] Nicolo Zeno, a Venetian, sailing northward for England, was
driven in a storm still farther north, and landed on some islands in possession
of the Northmen, which he named Friesland, but which are supposed to have
been the Faroe group. Kindly received by the people, he sent to Venice for
his brother, and both spent there the rest of their lives, making frequent excursions
to neighboring islands, and gaining a knowledge of other more
distant lands known to the Northmen, including two countries called Drogeo
and Estotiland, lying to the southward of Greenland, which countries the
Frieslanders claimed once to have visited. Nicolo died in 1395, and Antonio
in 1404, after writing an account of their adventures, which, with a chart, he
sent to a third brother, Carlo. The manuscript was preserved by the family
and first published under the title <i>Dei Commentarii del viaggio in Persia, etc.</i>,
Venezia, 1558. After passing the ordeal of criticism the work is generally
accepted as a faithful report of actual occurrences, though embellished, like
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_82' href='#Page_82'>82</a></span>
all writings of the time, with fable. <i>Dello Scoprimento dell' Isola Frislanda

<i>Lelewel</i>, <i>Géog. du moyen âge</i>, tom. iii. pp. 74 et seq.
Irving, however, <i>Columbus</i>, vol. iii. pp. 435-40, sees in this voyage only another
of "the fables circulated shortly after the discovery of Columbus, to
arrogate to other nations and individuals the credit of the achievement,"
while Zahrtmann, <i>Remarks on the Voy. to the Northern Hemisphere, ascribed
to the Zeni of Venice</i>, in <i>Journal of the Geog. Soc.</i>, vol. v. pp. 102-28, London,
1835, claims that the whole account is a fable.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
The chart by the brothers Zeni, published with the manuscript, is of
great importance as the first known map which shows any part of America.
It contains internal evidences of its own authenticity, one of which is that
Greenland is much better drawn than could have been done from other or extraneous
sources even in 1558. I give from Kohl's fac-simile a copy of the
map, omitting a few of the names.

There can be little doubt that the countries marked Estotiland, Drogeo,

their position on this chart to the actual knowledge of America, obtained
either by a fishing-vessel wrecked there, as stated by the Zeni, or from a
tradition preserved since the time of the Northmen. The lines of latitude
and longitude were not on the original manuscript chart, but were added by
the editors in 1558. <i>Lelewel</i>, <i>Géog. du moyen âge</i>, tom. iii. pp. 79-101,

At an unknown date, probably near the end of the thirteenth century,
Robert Machin, an Englishman, eloped with a lady in his own vessel from
Bristol. He steered for France, but was driven by a tempest to the island of
Madeira, where both died. Some of the crew escaped to the African coast,
where they were taken prisoners, but afterward were redeemed by the Spaniards,
to whom one of them related the discovery of Madeira, his account
leading to its rediscovery. Major concludes, "that henceforth the story of
this accidental discovery of Madeira by Machin must be accepted as a reality,"
but the date cannot be fixed. That of 1344 often assigned to the voyage
results from a misreading of Galvano. Beside <i>Galvano</i>, <i>Discov.</i>, pp. 58-9,

<div class="sidenote">PRINCE HENRY OF PORTUGAL.</div>

<p class="p2 blockquot">
We enter now a new epoch in maritime discovery. Hitherto, if we exclude
the voyages of the Northmen, there had been no attempt worthy the name
of systematic ocean exploration. In the words of Major, "the pathways of the
human race had been the mountain, the river, and the plain, the strait, the
lake, the inland sea," but now a road is open through the trackless ocean, "a
road replete with danger, but abundant in promise." Portugal, guided by the
genius of Prince Henry the Navigator, was the first to shake off the lethargy
which had so long rested on Europe. For some time past the Portuguese
had been gradually eclipsing the Italians in maritime enterprise; but not
until a prince leaves the pleasures of youth for the perils of the sea, throwing
his life into the cause with all the ardor of a devotee, does ocean navigation
become anything more than private commercial speculation, with now and then
some slight aid from governments. True, others had undertaken the voyage
round Africa, but Portugal was perhaps the first to make it. As D'Avesac
remarks, <i>Nouvelles Annales des Voy.</i>, 1846, tom. cx. p. 161: "Les Portugais
ne s'y engagèrent point les premiers; mais seuls ils y persevérèrent, et les
premiers ils atteignirent le but." Born in the year 1394, at a time when
under his father, John, Portugal was already casting wistful glances over the
Sea of Darkness, Prince Henry devoted his early life to geographical studies
and his later life to discovery. Leaving the pomp and luxury of his father's
court, he removed to the coast of Algarve, and from the dreary headland of
Sagres let fly his imagination along the unknown shores of Africa. Drawing
to him such young noblemen as were willing to share his labors, he established
a school of navigation, giving special care to the study of cartography
and mathematics. The geographical position of his native land was to the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_84' href='#Page_84'>84</a></span>
Portuguese, in regard to oceanic adventure, not unlike that of the Italians in
regard to Mediterranean navigation. Several causes united to inspire this
prince with so noble an ambition. He desired to promote geographical
science; to test the theories and traditions of the day; to know the truth
concerning the disputed question of the form and extent of southern Africa;
to turn the flow of riches, the gold and spices and slaves of India, from Italy
into his own country. Nor was this last stimulant lessened by the fact that
of late, by reason of Mahometan encroachments on Christian dominions, the
old avenues of eastern traffic <i>via</i> the Caspian Sea and Persian Gulf, or by the
Red Sea and caravans across the deserts, were yearly becoming more insecure,
and this too at a time when the taste for eastern luxuries was constantly increasing.
Yet other incentives were Christian rivalry and Christian zeal.
Spain had carried the cross to the Canaries; rumors kept coming in of Prester
John and his Christian kingdom, now supposed to be in Africa instead of in
Asia. Prince Henry moreover was grand master of the Order of Christ, and
it behooved him to be stirring. <i>Navarrete</i>, <i>Col. de Viages</i>, tom. i. p. xxvi.;
<i>Muñoz</i>, <i>Hist. Nuevo Mundo</i>, pp. 33-4.

<p class="blockquot">
[1415.] Prince Henry began his voyages along the coast of Africa about the
year 1415, at which time João de Trasto was sent with vessels to the Canaries.
It was Henry's custom to despatch an expedition almost every year,
endeavoring each time to advance upon the last, and so finally attain the end
of the mystery—whereat the nobles grumbled not a little about useless
expense. Obviously progress southward at this rate was very slow, and
many years elapsed before Cape Bojador was passed and unknown seas were
entered. <i>Major's Prince Henry</i>, pp. 64-65.

<p class="blockquot">
[1416-28.] Meanwhile Pedro, Henry's brother, travelled extensively, journeying

this year discovered by Cabral. Kunstmann, <i>Entdeckung Am.</i>, p. 15, makes

the eastern Atlantic islands, see <i>idem</i>, pp. 1-25.

[1434-6.] Gil Eannes, after an unsuccessful attempt in the preceding

Viages</i>, tom. i. p. xxvii., 1423. In 1435 Eannes with Baldaya passed fifty
leagues beyond the cape, and in 1436 Baldaya advanced to a point fifty
leagues beyond the inlet since known as Rio d'Ouro.

<div class="sidenote">THE SLAVE-TRADE.</div>

<p class="blockquot">
[1441-8.] For several years after the successful doubling of Cape Bojador,
no new attempt of importance is recorded, but in 1441 the voyages were
renewed, and in the next eight years the exploration was pushed one hundred
leagues below Cape Verde. Prior to 1446 fifty-one vessels had traded on the
African coast, nearly one thousand slaves had been taken to Portugal, and
the discoveries in the Azores had been greatly extended. By these explorations
Prince Henry had exploded the theory of a burning zone impassable to
man, and of stormy seas impeding all navigation; his belief that Africa
might be circumnavigated was confirmed; and he had obtained from the
pope a grant to the crown of Portugal of lands he might discover beyond
Cape Bojador to the Indies inclusive.

<p class="blockquot">
[1455-6.] According to Ramusio, <i>Viaggi</i>, tom. i. p. 105, Alvise Cadamosto,
a Venetian, the first of his countrymen as he claims to sail down
the new coast, made a voyage for Prince Henry to the Gambia River below
Cape Verde. This expedition derives its importance not from the limit reached,
where others had preceded him, but from his numerous landing points, careful
observations, and the detailed account published by the voyager himself in
<i>La Prima Navigazione, etc.</i>, Vicenza, 1507; also in <i>Ramusio</i>, <i>Viaggi</i>, tom. i.
pp. 104-15. This explorer touched at Porto Santo, Madeira, the Canaries,
Cape Blanco, Senegal, Budomel, Cape Verde, and the Gambia River.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
[1457.] Cadamosto claims, <i>La seconda navigazione</i>, in <i>Ramusio</i>, <i>Viaggi</i>,
tom. i. pp. 116-20, to have made a second voyage, during which he discovered
the Cape Verde Islands; but Major, <i>Prince Henry</i>, pp. 278-88, shows
that such a voyage was not made in that year, if at all.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
[1460.] Diogo Gomez discovered the Cape Verde Islands, and their colonization
was effected during the following years. Major, <i>Prince Henry</i>, pp.
288-99, publishes the original account for the first time in English. Prince
Henry died in November of this year. <i>Major's Prince Henry</i>, p. 303;
<i>Kunstmann</i>,
<i>Entdeckung Am.</i>, p. 19. Irving, <i>Columbus</i>, vol. i. p. 30, fixes this
date 1473; and Galvano, <i>Discov.</i>, p. 14, says 1463.

<p class="blockquot">
[1461.] The spirit of discovery and the thirst for African gold and slaves
had become too strong to receive more than a temporary check in the death
of its chief promoter. In the year following Prince Henry's death a fort was
built on the African coast to protect the already extensive trade, and in 1461
or 1462 Pedro de Cintra reached a point in nearly 5° north, being over six
hundred miles below the limit of Cadamosto's voyage. <i>La Nauigation del

[1469-89.] In 1469 Fernam Gomez rented the African trade from the king
of Portugal for a term of five years, and during that time pushed his explorations
under Santarem and Escobar to Cape St Catherine in 2° south,
first crossing the equator in 1471. Under João II., who succeeded Alfonso V.
in 1481, the traffic continued, and in 1489 Diogo Cam reached a point in 22°,
over two hundred leagues below the Congo River, planting there a cross
which is said to be yet standing. Martin Behaim, the mathematician and
cosmographer, accompanied Cam on this voyage, and an error or interpolation
in <i>Schedel</i>, <i>Registrum, etc.</i>, Nuremberg, 1493, gave rise to the unfounded
report that they sailed west and discovered America. <i>Humboldt</i>, <i>Exam. Crit.</i>,

We enter now the Columbian epoch proper, to which, as we have seen, the
enterprises of Prince Henry and the Portuguese were precursory. About
1484, Christopher Columbus having proposed a new scheme of reaching India
by sailing west, the king of Portugal surreptitiously sent a vessel to test his
theory, which, after searching unsuccessfully for land westward, returned to
the Cape Verde Islands. <i>Muñoz</i>, <i>Hist. Nuevo Mundo</i>, pp. 53-4 et al. Columbus
had resided in Portugal since 1470, and had made several trips in
Portuguese ships down the African coast, in the course of which he is supposed
to have first conceived his new project. Indignant at the conduct of
the Portuguese king, Columbus left for Spain. <i>Colon</i>, <i>Hist. del Almirante</i>, in

In 1486 Bartolomeu Dias sailed round Cape Good Hope and continued his
voyage to Great Fish River on the south-east coast, from which point he was
compelled to return on account of the murmurs of his men. The cape, now
for the first time doubled by Europeans, was seen and named by him on his
return. In 1487 King João sent two priests, Covilham and Payva, to travel
in the East, in the hope of gathering more definite information respecting
Prester John and his famous Christian kingdom. Prester John they did not
find, but Covilham in his wanderings reached Sofala on the east coast of
Africa in about 20° south latitude, being the first of his countrymen to sail on
the Indian Ocean. At Sofala he learned the practicability of the voyage
which Dias had actually accomplished a little before, and a message to that
effect was immediately sent to the king. <i>Major's Prince Henry</i>, pp. 339-42;

<p class="blockquot">
From this time to the great discovery of 1492, few expeditions remain
to be mentioned. It must not be forgotten, however, that by this time
trading voyages were of ordinary occurrence all along the eastern Atlantic
coast and its adjoining islands from Scandinavia to Guinea. A lively commerce
was carried on throughout this century between Bristol and Iceland,
and in the words of Kunstmann, substantiated by older authorities,
"a bull of Nicolas IV. to the bishops of Iceland, proves that the pope in
1448 was intimately acquainted with matters in Greenland." It seems incredible
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_87' href='#Page_87'>87</a></span>
that during all this intercourse with northern lands, no knowledge
of America was gained by southern maritime nations, yet so far as we know
there exists no proof of such knowledge.

<p class="blockquot">
[1476.] John of Kolno, or Szkolny, is reported to have made a voyage in
the service of the king of Denmark in 1476, and to have touched on the coast
of Labrador. The report rests on the authority of Wytfliet, <i>Descriptionis
Ptolemaicæ augmentum</i>, Lovanii, 1598, fol. 188, supported by a single sentence,
"Tambien han ydo alla hombres de Noruega con el Piloto Iuan
Scolno," in <i>Gomara</i>, <i>Hist. Gen. de las Indias</i>, Anvers, 1554, cap. xxxvii. fol.
31; by a similar sentence in <i>Herrera</i>, <i>Hist. Gen.</i>, Madrid, 1601, dec. i.
lib. vi. cap. xvi., in which the name is changed to Juan Seduco; and by the
inscription, <i>Jac Scolvus Groetland</i>, on a country west of Greenland on a map
made by Michael Lok in 1582, fac-simile in <i>Hakluyt Soc.</i>, <i>Divers Voy.</i>, p. 55.
According to Kohl, <i>Hist. Discov.</i>, pp. 114-15, this voyage is considered apocryphal
by Danish and Norwegian writers. Lelewel, <i>Géog. du moyen âge</i>, p.
106, regards the voyage as authentic, and Kunstmann, <i>Entdeckung Am.</i>, pp.
45-8, attaches to it great importance as the source of all the voyages to the
north which followed. Humboldt, <i>Exam. Crit.</i>, tom. ii. pp. 152-4, gives
but little attention to the voyage, and confesses his inability to decide on
its merits: "Je ne puis hasarder aucun jugement sur cette assertion de
Wytfliet."

<p class="blockquot">
[1477.] In this year Columbus, whom we first find with the Portuguese
traders on the African coast, sailed northward, probably with an English
merchantman from Bristol, to a point one hundred leagues beyond Thule, in
73° north. <i>Colon</i>, <i>Hist. del Almirante</i> in <i>Barcia</i>, tom. i. p. 4;
<i>Muñoz</i>, <i>Hist.
Nuevo Mundo</i>, pp. 43-7;
<i>Humboldt</i>, <i>Exam. Crit.</i>, tom. i. p. 272. He probably
visited Iceland, although he gives the latitude incorrectly, taking it very likely
from ancient geography rather than his own observations.

<p class="blockquot">
[1482.] According to Kunstmann, the edition of Ptolemy this year, <i>Ptolomæi
Cosmographia</i>, Ulmæ, 1482, lib. viii., contains a map that includes
Greenland, and must have been compiled from northern sources.

<p class="blockquot">
[1488.] Desmarquets, <i>Mémoires Chronologiques, etc.</i>, Dieppe, 1785, tom. i.
pp. 92-8, states that one Cousin sailed from Dieppe early in 1488, stood off
further from land than other voyagers had done, and after two months
reached an unknown land and a great river, which he named the Maragnon.
Was this the Marañon in South America? He then sailed south-eastward
and discovered the southern point of Africa, returning to Dieppe in 1489.
The discovery was kept secret, but Cousin made a second voyage round the
cape and succeeded in reaching India. Major, besides pointing out some inconsistencies
in this account, shows that M. Desmarquets "could commit
himself to assertions of great moment which are demonstrably false." He is
not good authority for so remarkable a discovery not elsewhere recorded.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE COLUMBIAN EPOCH.</div>

<p class="p2 blockquot">
Before striking out with Columbus in his bold venture to the west, let us
sum up what we have learned thus far and see where we stand. First, the
geographical knowledge of the ancients was restricted to a parallelogram extending
north-west and south-east from the Atlantic to the Indian ocean,
comprising one hundred and twenty degrees east and west by fifty degrees
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_88' href='#Page_88'>88</a></span>
north and south; circumscribe this knowledge with legendary stories and
hypothetical and traditional beliefs concerning the regions beyond; then add
a true theory of the earth's sphericity, though mistaken as to its size. This
is all they knew, and this knowledge they committed to the Dark Age, during
which time it was preserved, and, indeed, little by little enlarged, as we
have seen. During the latter part of the fifteenth century, particularly, a
powerful impulse had been given to discovery, especially toward the south;
so that now the limits of the ancients were moved eastward at least forty
degrees, to the eastern coasts and islands of Asia, chiefly by the travels of Marco
Polo and Sir John Mandeville. Toward the south, the true form of Africa
had been ascertained, and its coasts had been explored by the Portuguese,
except a space of about fifteen degrees on the south-west. Northward the old
limit had been advanced but slightly, but within this limit much information
had been gained by actual navigation about regions only vaguely described
by Ptolemy. Westward, in what was still a Sea of Darkness, great discoveries
had been made by the Northmen, but their results were now practically
lost; while toward the south, several important groups of islands had been
added to the known world. See <a href="#i-147">map on page 73</a>, where the regions added
during this period are lightly shaded. And now, within the old bound the
world is much better known than at the beginning of the period, and many
minor geographical errors of the ancients have been corrected by the Crusaders,
and others who attempted on a smaller scale to extend the Catholic faith,
as well as by commercial travellers in distant lands. Again, by the influx
of Mahometans into Europe during five or six centuries, eastern luxuries
had been introduced to an extent hitherto unknown, and had in fact become
necessities in Christian courts, thus making the India trade the great field of
commercial enterprise even by the tedious and uncertain overland routes
where middle-men absorbed the profits, and rendering the opening of other
and easier routes an object of primary importance. The almost exclusive
possession of trade <i>via</i> the old routes by the Italians, furnished an additional
motive to other European nations for explorations by sea. The art of printing,
recently invented, facilitated the diffusion of learning, so that it was impossible
for the world ever again to lapse into the old intellectual darkness.
The astrolabe, the foundation of the modern quadrant, had been adapted by
a meeting of cosmographers in Portugal to the observation of latitudes by
the sun's altitude, and thus the chief obstacle to long sea-voyages was removed.
The polarity of the magnet had long been known, but the practical
adaptation of the magnetic needle to purposes of navigation occurred about
the beginning of the fourteenth century. The mariner's compass, however,
only attained its highest purpose toward the close of the fifteenth century,
when the Sea of Darkness was traversed. But before this, the greatest impediments
to ocean navigation had been overcome by voyages actually made
through the aid of the new inventions. Beside the coasts brought to light
by these voyages, they had done much to dispel the old superstitions of burning
zones, impassable capes, and unnavigable seas.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">REAL AND IMAGINARY ISLANDS.</div>

<p class="blockquot">
We have seen that, as a result either of the poetic fancy or of the actual
discovery of the ancients, various islands were traditionally located in the
Atlantic. Most of them undoubtedly owed their existence to the natural
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_89' href='#Page_89'>89</a></span>
tendency of man to people unknown seas with fabulous lands and beings,
"Il est si naturel à l'homme de rêver quelque chose au-delà de l'horizon visible,"
observes Humboldt. For a full account of the history and location of
these islands, "dont la position est encore plus variable que le nom," and the
important part played by them in ancient and middle-age geography, see
<i>Humboldt</i>, <i>Exam. Crit.</i>, tom. ii. pp. 156-245, and <i>Kunstmann</i>, <i>Entdeckung
Am.</i>, pp. 6 et seq., and 35-37. In the fifteenth century, with the revival of
maritime enterprise, came a renewal and multiplication of the old fables.
Monastic scholars, by their continued study of the old writers, by their attempts
to reconcile ancient geography with fabulous events in the lives of the
saints, and by their inevitable tendency to exaggeration, had contributed
largely to their preservation. Still, throughout the preceding period, the belief
in the existence of such islands had been vague and hypothetical; but
when the actual existence of numerous islands in the western ocean was proved,
and the Canary, Madeira, Azore, and Cape Verde groups were discovered
and explored, the old ideas were naturally revived and confirmed, and with
them rose a desire to rediscover all that had been known to the ancient voyagers.
The reported wonders of the fabulous isles, having on them great and
rich cities, were confidently sought in each newly found land, and not appearing
in any of them, the islands themselves were successively located farther
and farther to the west, out in the mysterious sea, to be surely brought
to light by future explorations.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
And of a truth, this wondrous western empire was subsequently brought to
light; peoples and cities were found, but beyond the limits within which the
wildest dreams of their discoverers had ever placed them. On this foundation
not a few speculators build a theory that America was known to the
ancients. The chief of the hypothetical isles were San Brandan, Antilia,
and the Island of the Seven Cities; their existence was firmly believed in, and
they were definitely located on maps of the period. San Brandan is said to
have been visited by the saint whose name it bears in the sixth century.
It was at first located far north and west of Ireland, but gradually moved
southward until at the time of Columbus' first voyage it is found nearly in
the latitude of Cape Verde. To the inflamed imagination mirage is solid
earth, or sea, or a beautiful city; an island which was long supposed to
be visible from Madeira and the Canaries had something to do with the location
of this island of the saint, and of the others.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
Antilia, and the Island of Seven Cities, according to Behaim's map, are
identical. See <a href="#Page_93">page 93 this volume</a>; also a reputed letter of Toscanelli, about
the existence of which Humboldt thinks there may be some doubt. The
only tangible point in the traditionary history is the migration of seven
bishops, driven from the Peninsula by the Moorish invasion in the eighth
century, who took refuge there and built the Seven Cities. The history and
location of this Island of the Seven Cities in the fifteenth century are similar
to those of San Brandan Island. Galvano says a Portuguese ship was there
in 1447. Brazil, Bracie, or Berzil, was another of these wandering isles,
whose name has been preserved and applied to a rock west of Ireland, to one
of the Azore islands, and to a country in South America. This name has
been the theme of much discussion, which, so far as I know, leads to no
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_90' href='#Page_90'>90</a></span>
result beyond the fact that the name of a valuable dye-wood known to
the ancients was afterward applied to lands known or conjectured to produce
such woods. <i>Humboldt</i>, <i>Exam. Crit.</i>, tom. ii. pp. 214-45;
<i>Kunstmann</i>,
<i>Entdeckung Am.</i>, pp. 7-10, and 35 et seq. Kunstmann attaches greater geographical
importance to the fabulous isles than Humboldt, connecting them
in a manner apparently not quite clear to himself with the previous discoveries
of the Northmen. Thus stood facts and fancies concerning the geography
of the world, when the greatest of discoverers arose and achieved the
greatest of discoveries.
</p>

<p class="p2 blockquot">
Although in the chapters following I speak more at length of the deeds
of the Genoese and his companions, yet in order to complete this Summary
it is necessary to mention them here. I shall attempt no discussion concerning
the country, family, date of birth, or early life of Christopher Columbus.
For the differences of opinion on these points, with numerous references, see
<i>Harrisse</i>, <i>Bibliotheca Americana Vetustissima</i>, New York, 1866, p. 2 et seq.
Born somewhere in Italy, probably Genoa, about 1435, he received something
more than a rudimentary education, went to sea at the early age of fourteen,
and in 1470, which is about the date of his coming to Portugal, had already
an extensive experience in the navigation of the Mediterranean, and was
skilled in the theory as well as the practice of his profession. We have already
seen him with the Portuguese on the African coast, and with the English
in Iceland. In fact, before his first voyage westward in 1492, he was
practically acquainted with all waters then navigated by Europeans.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
The promptings which urged forward this navigator to the execution of his
great enterprise may be stated as follows: The success of the Portuguese in
long voyages down the African coast suggested to his mind, soon after 1470,
that if they could sail so far south, another might sail west with the same
facility and perhaps profit. Says his son: "Estando en Portugal, empeçó à
congeturar, que del mismo modo que los Portugueses navegaron tan lejos al
Mediodia, podria navegarse la buelta de Occidente, i hallar tierra en aquel
viage." <i>Colon</i>, <i>Hist. del Almirante</i>, in <i>Barcia</i>, tom. i. p. 4; edition of Venetia,
1709, pp. 22-3;
<i>Humboldt</i>, <i>Exam. Crit.</i>, tom. i. p. 12;
<i>Navarrete</i>, <i>Col. de
Viages</i>, tom. i. p. lxxix;
<i>Herrera</i>, <i>Hist. Gen.</i>, dec. i. lib. i. cap. 1-7. His
ardent imagination once seized with this idea, every nook and corner of
geographical knowledge was searched for evidence to support his theory.
By intercourse with other navigators he learned that at different times and
places along the western coasts of Europe and Africa, objects apparently
from unknown western lands had been washed ashore, suppositionally
by the wind, really by the Gulf Stream or other oceanic currents.
<i>Humboldt</i>, <i>Exam. Crit.</i>, tom. ii. p. 249. Though well aware of existing
rumors of islands seen at different times in the western ocean, it was
not upon these, if any such there were, that he built his greatest
anticipations of success. In the writings of the ancients he found
another stimulant. Filled with fervent piety and superstitious credulity,
he pored over every cosmographical work upon which he could lay
his hands, as well the compilations of antiquated notions, such as the <i>Imago
Mundi</i> of Pierre D'Ailly, or the more modern travels of Marco Polo and

<div class="sidenote">EVOLUTION OF THE GRAND CONCEPTION.</div>

<p class="blockquot">
The result of these studies was a complete acquaintance with the geographical
knowledge of the day, with the greater part of what I have thus
far epitomized, the doings of the Northmen excepted. From all this he
knew of the earth's sphericity; he believed that the larger part of the world's
surface was dry land; that the land known to Ptolemy extended over at least
180 degrees, or half the circumference of the globe, that is, from the Canaries
to the Ganges; he knew that by later travels the eastern limit of geographical
knowledge had been moved much farther east, even to Cathay; he believed
that far out in the ocean lay the island of Zipangu; he knew that some eight
or ten degrees had been added on the west by the discovery of the Azores;
he believed that at most only one third of the circumference remained to be
navigated; that this space might naturally contain some islands available
as way stations in the voyage; that the explorations in the East were very
indefinite, and consequently Asia might, and probably did, extend farther east
than was supposed; that Ptolemy's figures were not undisputed—Marino
making the distance from the Canaries to the Ganges 225 degrees instead of
180, while another geographer, Alfragano, by actual measurement, made each
degree about one sixth smaller than Ptolemy, thus reducing the size of the
earth, and with it the remaining distance to India; that several ancient
writers—see quotations from Aristotle, Strabo, Seneca, et al., in <i>Humboldt</i>,
<i>Exam. Crit.</i>, tom. i. pp. 38, 61, 98 et seq.—had pronounced the distance to
India very short, and had affirmed that it might be navigated in a few days;
and finally that other scholars, as Toscanelli, had arrived at the same conclusions
as himself, possibly before himself. <i>Cartas de Pablo Toscanelli, Físico
Florentin, á Cristobal Colon y al Canónigo Portugues Fernando Martinez, sobre
el descubrimiento de las Indias</i>, in <i>Navarrete</i>, tom. ii. pp. 1-4;
<i>Muñoz</i>, <i>Hist.
Nuevo Mundo</i>, pp. 48-9. See also, on Columbus' motives, <i>Irving's Columbus</i>,
vol. i. pp. 42-51, and vol. ii. p. 148;
<i>Muñoz</i>, <i>Hist. Nuevo Mundo</i>, pp. 45-7;
<i>Humboldt</i>, <i>Exam. Crit.</i>, tom. ii. pp. 324-9;
<i>Stevens' Notes</i>, p. 28;
<i>Major's
Prince Henry</i>, pp. 347-52;
<i>Kunstmann</i>, <i>Entdeckung Am.</i>, p. 74. Many of
these conclusions were erroneous, being founded on an incorrect idea of longitude;
but this reduction of the earth's size was an error most fortunate for
discovery, inasmuch as with a correct idea of the distance to be traversed,
and with no suspicion of an intervening continent, such an expedition as that
of the Genoese would not have been undertaken at the time.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
Such were the ideas and aspirations of Columbus before his undertakings;
later in life a theologic mysticism took possession of his mind, and his success
was simply a fulfillment of divine prophecy in which cosmographical
realities went for nothing. See <i>Cartas de Don Cristobal Colon</i>, in <i>Navarrete</i>,
tom. i. p. 330.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
All attempts to diminish the glory of Columbus' achievement by proving a
previous discovery whose results were known to him have signally failed.
The reports of mysterious maps which have been claimed to have prompted
his enterprise evidently amount to nothing in view of the fact that Columbus
never suspected the existence of any new countries, yet that he saw maps
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_92' href='#Page_92'>92</a></span>
of the world, including the Asiatic coasts, can not be doubted. The case of
the pilot Sanchez, said to have died in the house of Columbus, and to have
told him of lands he had seen toward the west, if true, is likewise of little
moment as touching the honor due to Columbus, for many men were confident
of having seen such lands from the Canaries and other islands, and several
voyages had been made in search of them, all of which was certainly
known to Columbus. The story of Sanchez was started by Oviedo, who
gives no authority or date for the event; it was repeated generally with disapproval
by other historians, until revived by Garcilaso de la Vega with date
and details; but his date, 1484, is ten years after Columbus is known to have
proposed his scheme to the Portuguese government. Columbus originated
no new theory respecting the earth's form or size, though a popular idea has
always prevailed, notwithstanding the statements of the best writers to the
contrary, that he is entitled to the glory of the theory as well as to that of
the execution of the project. He was not in advance of his age, entertained
no new theories, believed no more than did Prince Henry, his predecessor, or
Toscanelli, his contemporary; nor was he the first to conceive the possibility
of reaching the east by sailing west. He was however the first to act
in accordance with existing beliefs. The Northmen in their voyages had entertained
no ideas of a New World, or of an Asia to the west. To knowledge
of theoretical geography, Columbus added the skill of a practical navigator,
and the iron will to overcome obstacles. He sailed west, reached Asia as
he believed, and proved old theories correct.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
There seem to be two undecided points in that matter, neither of which
can ever be settled. First, did his experience in the Portuguese voyages, the
perusal of some old author, or a hint from one of the few men acquainted
with old traditions, first suggest to Columbus his project? In the absence
of sustaining proof, the statement of the son Fernando that the father should
be credited with the reconception of the great idea, goes for little. Second,
to what extent did his voyage to the north influence his plan? There is no
evidence, but a strong probability, that he heard in that voyage of the
existence of land in the west. It is hardly possible that no tradition of
Markland and Vinland remained in Iceland, when but little more than a
hundred years had passed since the last ship had returned from those
countries, and when many persons must have been living who had been in
Greenland. If such traditions did exist, Columbus certainly must have
made himself acquainted with them. Still his visit to the north was in 1477,
several years after the first formation of his plan, and any information gained
at the time could only have been confirmatory rather than suggestive. Both
Humboldt and Kunstmann think that even if he ever heard of the discoveries
of the Northmen—which is thought probable by the latter—this knowledge
would not have agreed with, nor encouraged, his plans. Kohl, <i>Hist.
Discov.</i>, pp. 115-20, believes that such a knowledge would have been the
strongest possible confirmation of his idea of the nearness of Asia and Europe,
in which opinion I concur. The idea of Draper, <i>Hist. Int. Develop.</i>, p. 446,
that had Columbus known of the northern discoveries he would have steered
farther to the north, seems of no weight, since he sought not the northern but
the southern parts of India.

<div class="sidenote">FIRST VOYAGE OF COLUMBUS.</div>

<p class="blockquot">
What Columbus had to contend with at this juncture was not, as I have
said, old doctrines oppugnant to any new conception, but the ignorance
of the masses, who held no doctrine beyond that of proximate sense, which
spread out the earth's surface, so far as their dull conceptions could reach,
in one universal flatness; and the knowledge of courts, whence alone the
great discoverer could hope for support, was but little in advance of that
of the people. Then the Church, with its usual firmness and conservatism,
was against him. The monks, who were then the guardians of
learning, knew, or might have known, all that Prince Henry, Columbus,
and other earnest searchers had ascertained regarding the geography of
the earth; but what were science and facts to them if they in any wise conflicted
with the preconceived notions of the Fathers, or with Church dogmas?
"II est vrai," says Humboldt, "que les scrupules théologiques de Lactance,
de St. Chrysostôme et de quelques autres Pères de l'Eglise, contribuèrent à
pousser l'esprit humain dans un mouvement rétrograde." And again, the
African expeditions of the Portuguese had not on the whole been profitable
or encouraging to other similar undertakings, and the financial condition of
most European courts was not such as to warrant new expenses. Portugal,
more advanced and in better condition to embark in new enterprises than
any other nation, now regarded the opening of her route to India <i>via</i> the Cape
of Good Hope an accomplished fact, and therefore looked coldly on any new
venture. Nor were the extravagant demands of Columbus with respect to
titles and authority over the new regions of Asia which he hoped to find,
likely to inspire monarchs, jealous of their dignities, with favor toward a
penniless, untitled adventurer. Passing as well the successive disappointments
of Columbus in his weary efforts to obtain the assistance necessary to
the accomplishment of his project, as his final success with Queen Isabella of
Castile, let us resume our chronological summary.

<p class="blockquot">
[1492.] Shortly before the sailing of Columbus, the learned astronomer
Martin Behaim, of Nuremberg, constructed a globe showing the whole surface
of the earth as understood by the best geographers of the time. This globe
has been preserved, and I present a fac-simile of the American hemisphere
published in <i>Ghillany</i>, <i>Geschichte des Seefahrers Ritter Martin Behaim</i>, Nürnberg,
1853. The entire globe may be seen in <i>Jomard</i>, <i>Les Monuments de la
Géographie</i>, no. xv., Paris, 1854. A section of the globe is given by Irving,
<i>Columbus</i>, vol. i. p. 53 (see also <i>Id.</i>, p. 135), by <i>London Geog. Soc. Journal</i>,
1848, vol. xviii. p. 76; and a copy from Ghillany, with some of the names
omitted, may be found in <i>Kohl's Hist. Discov.</i>, p. 147, map no. iv.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
The chart by which the voyage of Columbus was made is supposed to have
been a copy of Behaim's Globe, which indeed may be regarded as the exponent
of geographical conceptions, those of Columbus as well as those of the
learned men and practical navigators of the day. By an inscription on the
original, the Asiatic coast is known to have been laid down from Marco Polo,
and to the islands of Antilia and San Brandan are joined other inscriptions
giving their history as I have before indicated. Sailing from Palos on the
3d of August, 1492, with one hundred and twenty men in three vessels
commanded by himself and the two brothers Pinzon, Columbus was at last
fairly launched on the Sea of Darkness. After a detention of three weeks at
the Canaries, he sailed thence the 6th of September; marked, not without
alarm, the variation of the needle on the 30th of September; and on the 12th
of October discovered San Salvador, or Cat Island.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
So far all was well; all was as the bold navigator had anticipated; all accorded
with current opinions, his own among the number; he had sailed certain
days, had accomplished a certain distance, and had reached triumphantly
one of the numerous islands mentioned by Marco Polo, and, God willing,
would soon find the larger island of Zipangu. Alas for mathematical calculations,
for that other third of the earth's circumference; alas for the intervening
continent and broad Pacific sea, which baffled the great discoverer to
the day of his death!
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
Passing over the cruise through the Bahamas, or Marco Polo's archipelago
of seven thousand islands, in which the discoverers touched successively at
Concepcion, Exuma (Fernandina), and Isla Larga (Isabela), we find Columbus
sailing from the last-mentioned island on the 24th of October for Zipangu,
with the intention of proceeding thence to the main-land, and presenting his
credentials to the great Khan.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
Touching at the Mucaras group, Columbus arrived at Zipangu, which
was none other than the island of Cuba, on the 28th of October, and gave
to the island, in place of its barbarous appellation, the more Christian
name of Juana. Cruising along the northern shore of Cuba, in frequent
converse with the natives, he soon learned that this was not Zipangu, was
not even an island, but was the veritable Asiatic continent itself, for so
his fervid mind interpreted the strange language of this people. Unfortunately
he could not find the Khan; after diligent search he could find
no great city, nor any imperial court, nor other display of oriental opulence
such as were described by Marco Polo and Sir John Mandeville—only naked
barbarians and thatched huts; so after advancing west beyond Savana la
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_95' href='#Page_95'>95</a></span>
Mar, the discoverers returned to the eastern end of Cuba, visiting on the way
the group El Jardin del Rey. Postponing the exploration of the coast toward
the south-west, Columbus returned eastward and followed the northern coast
of Española, turning off on his way to discover the Tortugas, and arriving at
La Navidad, where he built a fort and left a colony of thirty-nine men. Now,
Española, and not Cuba as he had at first supposed, was the true Zipangu;
for the main-land of China could not by any possibility be the island of
Japan; and in this belief Columbus sailed for Spain on the 16th of January,
reaching the Azores on the 18th of February, and arriving at Palos the
15th of March, 1493. <i>Primer viage de Colon</i>, in <i>Navarrete</i>, tom. i. pp. 1-197;

<p class="blockquot">
[1493.] Just before reaching the Azores, Columbus wrote on shipboard
two letters describing his voyage, one under date of the 15th of February,
and the other of the 14th of March. The manuscript of one, with
copies printed in Spain probably during this same year, are yet preserved.
Of the other, both the original manuscript and Spanish copies, if any
were printed, are lost; but of a Latin translation, six editions are extant,
supposed to have been printed in 1493, in France and in Italy, under the
title <i>Epistola Christofori Colom</i>, or <i>De Insulis Inventis</i>, etc. A poetical paraphrase
of the same letter appeared the same year as <i>Dati</i>, <i>Questa e la Hystoria</i>,
etc., Florence, 1493, and four other works of this year contain slight allusions
to Columbus. Seven or eight editions of Columbus' letters appeared in different
forms during the next forty years. Both letters may be found with
Spanish translations in the first volume of Navarrete's collection. For the
bibliographical notices of this sketch I have depended chiefly on Harrisse,
<i>Bib. Am. Vet.</i>, as the latest and most complete essay on early American
books, notwithstanding the few blunders that have subjected it to so much
ridicule. I shall not consider it necessary to repeat the reference with each
notice, as Harrisse's work is arranged chronologically.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">PAPAL BULL OF PARTITION.</div>

<p class="blockquot">
As soon as Columbus had explained to Ferdinand and Isabella the nature
of his important discovery, the Spanish sovereigns applied to the Pope for
the same grants and privileges respecting lands discovered, and to be discovered,
in the west, that had before been granted the Portuguese in the south
and east. His Holiness, accepting the Spanish statements that the concessions
demanded did not in any way conflict with previous grants to the Portuguese,
by bull of May 2, 1493, ceded to Spain all lands which might be
discovered by her west of a line drawn from pole to pole, one hundred leagues
west of the Azores; the Portuguese to have all new lands east of the same
line. It is obvious that his Holiness fixed this line arbitrarily, without a
thought of the position or importance of the corresponding meridian at the
antipodes. This opposite meridian, according to the idea of longitude entertained
at the time, would fall in the vicinity of India proper; and the Portuguese,
besides their natural jealousy of this new success of Spain, feared that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_96' href='#Page_96'>96</a></span>
the western hemisphere thus given to her rival might include portions of
their Indian grants. Hence arose much trouble in the few following years
between the two courts. See <i>infra</i>.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
Amidst the enthusiasm following his success Columbus had no difficulty
in fitting out another expedition. Embarking from Cádiz September 25,
1493, with seventeen vessels and over 1,200 men, among whom were Alonso
de Ojeda and Juan de la Cosa, <i>el almirante</i>, or the admiral, as Columbus was
now called, touched at the Canaries, discovered Dominica the 3d of November,
and Guadalupe a few days later; thence sailing north-west through the
Caribbean Archipelago, he occasionally landed and gave names to islands.
Resting two days at Puerto Rico, he reached the coast of Española on the 22d
of November, and on the 27th anchored off the port of Navidad. The settlement
established at this place in the previous voyage had totally disappeared;
the colonists as is supposed falling victims to internal dissensions
and general excesses. A new city called Isabela was then founded at another
port of this island, and Ojeda was sent inland to explore the country.
After a short absence he returned, reporting the country rich in gold. On
the second of February, 1494, twelve vessels, with specimens of the people
and products of the country, were despatched for Spain under Antonio de
Torres. By this departure was also sent a request for immediate supplies.
Recovering from a serious illness, Columbus checked a revolt among his people
on the 24th of April, built a fort in the interior, and then sailed to explore
the main coast of Asia—as he supposed, but in truth Cuba—south-westward
from the point where he left it on his first voyage. Following the south
coast of Cuba the admiral at length reached the vicinity of Philipina, or
Cortés Bay, where the shore bends to the southward. This to him seemed
conclusive proof that it was indeed the main-land of Asia which he was
coasting. The statements of the natives who said that Cuba was in fact an
island, but that it was so large that no one had ever reached its western extremity,
confirmed him in his belief—since one might question the knowledge
of a boundary which no one had ever reached and from which no one
had ever come. The theory of the age was thus made good, and that
was sufficient; so Columbus brought all his crew, officers and men, before the
notary, and made them swear that the island of Cuba was the continent of
Asia—an act significant of methods of conversion in those days. He even
proposed to continue the voyage along the coast to the Red Sea, and thence
home by way of the Mediterranean, or, better still, round the Cape of Good
Hope, to meet and surprise the Portuguese; but his companions thought the
supplies insufficient for so long a voyage, and the admiral was persuaded
to postpone the attempt.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
Returning therefore to Española, on the way back Columbus discovered
and partially explored Jamaica, Isla de Pinos, and the small islands scattered
to the southward of Cuba, arriving at Isabela on the 4th of September.
There he found matters in a bad way. The colony, comprising a motley crew
of lawless adventurers, ever ready to attribute success to themselves and ill-fortune
to their governor, trumped up numerous complaints which caused the
admiral no little trouble. Margarite, to whom had been given a command
for an expedition inland, had revolted and sailed with several ships for Spain.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_97' href='#Page_97'>97</a></span>
Open war had been declared with the natives, and the colonists were hard
pressed; but the admiral's presence and Ojeda's impetuous bravery soon
secured order. Meanwhile two arrivals inspired the colonists with fresh
courage; that of Bartolomé Colon, brother of the admiral, with three ships,
and that of Torres, with four vessels laden with supplies. With the gold
that had been accumulated, and specimens of fruits and plants, and five
hundred natives as slaves, Torres was sent back to Spain, accompanied by
Diego Colon, whose mission was to defend his brother's interests at court.
The pacification of the natives was then completed, and heavy taxes were imposed
upon them. In October, 1495, arrived Juan de Aguado, sent by the
king to ascertain the facts concerning charges against the admiral. This man,
in place of executing his commission fairly, only stirred up the accusers of
Columbus to greater enmity—which quality of justice well accorded with
the temper of his master Ferdinand. On account of these troubles, as well
as from the discovery of a new gold mine, which proved beyond question
that Española was the ancient Ophir of King Solomon, Columbus decided to
return to Spain. So leaving his brother, Bartolomé, in command as <i>adelantado</i>,
or lieutenant-governor, he sailed with Aguado, on the 10th of March, in
two caravels, carrying 225 Spaniards and thirty natives. Touching at Marigalante,
and Guadalupe, he arrived at Cádiz June 11, 1496. <i>Segundo Viage de

<p class="blockquot">
[1494.] Thus during the absence of Columbus on his second voyage we
have seen the ocean route between Spain and Española six times navigated;
first, by the fleet of twelve vessels sent back to Spain by the admiral under
Antonio de Torres; second, by Bartolomé Colon, who followed his brother to
Española with three ships; third, by Margarite, who revolted and left Española
during the absence of Columbus in Cuba; fourth, by Torres in command of
four vessels from Spain with supplies for the colony; fifth, by the return of
the same four ships to Spain with gold and slaves; and sixth, by Juan de
Aguado with four ships from Spain in August, 1495.

<div class="sidenote">REPARATION OF THE WORLD.</div>

<p class="p2 blockquot">
With the division of the world by Pope Alexander VI., Portugal was not
satisfied. The world was thought to be not so large then as now, and one half
of it was not enough for so small a kingdom which had boasted so great a navigator
as Prince Henry. It was not their own side, but the other side, that
troubled the Portuguese, fearing as they did that the opposite meridian threw
into Spain's half a part or the whole of India. So Spain and Portugal fell to
quarrelling over this partition by his Holiness; and the matter was referred
to a commission, and finally settled by the treaty of Tordesillas in June,
1494, which moved the line 270 leagues farther west. About the location of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_98' href='#Page_98'>98</a></span>
this line of demarcation, and its effect on Brazil, and the Moluccas, much
has been written, though little has been said as to the motive that prompted
Portugal in making this change. The fact is, that at a time when the Spice
Islands were but vaguely known, and the existence of Brazil not even suspected,
it is impossible to conceive why Portugal desired to change the partition
line from 100 leagues to 370 leagues west of the Azores; for the change
could only diminish the possessions of Portugal in India by 270 leagues, as
in truth it did, including the Moluccas in the loss, and gaining in return 270
leagues of open Atlantic sea! True, there proved to be an accidental gain of
a part of Brazil, but there could have been no idea at the time that this partition
line cut through any eastern portion of lands discovered by Columbus
to the west. In whatever light we imagine them to have regarded it, there is
still an unexplained mystery. The Pacific ocean was unknown; between the
discoveries of Spain and Portugal, so far as known, all was land—India. By
carrying the partition line westward, Portugal may have thought to find some
western land; at all events, it is generally believed that the effect of the partition
in the antipodes was not well considered; that the only point in question
was the right of making discoveries in the western ocean, and that the treaty
of Tordesillas was decided in favor of Spain—Portugal being forced to yield
the main point, but insisting on the change of partition in order to give her
more sea-room. On the other hand it may be claimed that the antipodes, of
which they knew so little, were the avowed object of all the expeditions sent
out by both parties. See the original bull and treaty in <i>Navarrete</i>, <i>Col. de
Viages</i>, tom. ii. pp. 28, 130; also <i>Prescott's Ferdinand and Isabella</i>, vol. ii. pp.

<p class="blockquot">
Italy, and especially Venice, as we have seen, was the first of the European
states to display in any marked degree in mediæval times that commercial
spirit so early and so well developed in the Phœnicians. Portugal caught
the flame under John the Great, 1385-1433, and led the van of a more daring
discovery and exploration by conquests on the north-west coast of Africa.
Simultaneously Prince Henry was sending expeditions farther down the western
coast of Africa, and among the islands of the Atlantic. His country
reaped the reward in 1486, when the discovery of the Cape of Good Hope
opened her a way by sea to Hindostan, and to the commerce of the Orient,
and gave at the same time the death-blow to Venetian ascendancy in that
market.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
But Spain, as chance would have it, did not lag far behind her sister kingdom.
The fact of the great navigators, Columbus and Vespucci, being
Italians, and yet having to seek assistance of Spain, sufficiently indicates in
what direction the swing of maritime power was tending. The astronomical
schools of Córdova, Seville, and Granada had well prepared Spain for the
application of astronomy to navigation, and the long internal wars had bred
those bold and enduring spirits who alone are fitted to conduct with success
great enterprises of certain danger and uncertain result.
</p>

<p class="p2 blockquot">
It is claimed by some that John and Sebastian Cabot made their first voyage
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_99' href='#Page_99'>99</a></span>
and discovered Newfoundland in 1494. The claim rests on a statement
of the Spanish ambassador to England in a letter dated July 25, 1498, to
the effect that during the past seven years several vessels had been sent each
year from Bristol in search of Brasil and the Islands of the Seven Cities,
and on an inscription on Sebastian Cabot's map of 1544, which states that
land was first discovered by the Cabots on June 24, 1494. <i>D'Avesac</i>, <i>Letter
on the Voyages of John and Sebastian Cabot</i>, in <i>Kohl</i>, pp. 506-7. But other
authors consider the map—even if made by Cabot, which is extremely
doubtful—insufficient authority to prove such a voyage.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
[1495.] At the solicitation of the brothers Pinzon and other navigators, a
license was granted April 10, 1495, permitting any native-born Spaniard to
make private voyages for trade and discovery from Cádiz to the Western
India; such expeditions to be under the inspection of government, one of whose
officials was to accompany each vessel to ensure the payment to the crown of
one tenth of the profit of the voyage. For this document in full, see <i>Navarrete</i>,
<i>Col. de Viages</i>, tom. ii. p. 165. See also <i>Humboldt</i>, <i>Exam. Crit.</i>, tom.
i. pp. 356 et seq. Whether any one actually took advantage of this license
before its repeal—which was on June 2, 1497, at the instigation of Columbus—is
a disputed point of some importance in connection with certain doubtful
expeditions to be considered hereafter.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
[1496.] Pedro Alonso Niño sailed from Cádiz June 17, 1496, just after the
return of Columbus, in command of three vessels laden with supplies for the
colony at Española.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">AMERIGO VESPUCCI.</div>

<p class="p2 blockquot">
[1497.] Amerigo Vespucci, a Florentine navigator, claims to have set sail
from Cádiz with four vessels in the service of the king of Spain on the tenth,
or twentieth, of May, 1497. In what capacity he accompanied the expedition,
or who was its commander, he does not state, but says that he was
chosen by the king to go with the expedition. "Me ad talia investiganda
in ipsam societatem elegit." Sailing south-south-west to the Canaries,
280 leagues from Lisbon, he remained there eight days, and then sailed
west-one-quarter-south-west 1,000 leagues in twenty-seven, or thirty-seven,
days, to a point on the main-land in 16° north and 75° west of the Canaries—that
is to say, on the coast of Central America near Cape Gracias
á Dios. This must have been about the 1st of July, some days perhaps
after Cabot's landing farther north, which was the 24th of June. The
Spaniards went ashore in boats, but the natives were too timid to trade;
so that continuing their voyage for two days north-west in sight of the flat
coast, they reached a more secure anchorage, established friendly relations
with the people, and found some traces of gold. The ships then followed the
coast for several days, to a port where was found a village built over the
water like Venice, and there fought with the natives (of Tabasco?); sailed
eighty leagues along the coast to a region of many rivers (Pánuco?), where
they were kindly received by people of a different language, and made a journey
of eighteen leagues inland, visiting many towns. This province was
called by the inhabitants Lariab, and is situated in the torrid zone, near the
tropic of Cancer, in 23° north. Again they started, pursued a north-west
course and frequently anchored, sailing thus 870 leagues, until after thirteen
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_100' href='#Page_100'>100</a></span>
months, that is to say in June, 1498, they reached "the best harbor in the
world" (port of Cape Cañaveral?), in 28° 30', where they resolved to repair
their ships for the return voyage. There they remained thirty-seven days, and
when about to depart, the natives complained of certain cannibals who came
each year from an island 100 leagues distant to attack them. The Spaniards,
in return for their kindness, promised to avenge their wrongs. Accordingly
they sailed north-east and east to a group of islands, some of which were
inhabited (Bermudas?); landing at one of them called Ity, they defeated the
cannibals, and made 250 prisoners, with a loss of one man killed and twenty-two
wounded. Returning, they arrived at Cádiz October 15, 1499, with
222 prisoners, who were sold as slaves. The above is the account given
by Vespucci in a letter written in 1504, according to the edition adopted
as authentic and original by Varnhagen, <i>Le premier Voyage de Amerigo
Vespucci</i>, who believes that Vicente Yañez Pinzon and Juan Diaz de
Solis were the commanders. This voyage is not generally regarded as authentic;
and a long and complicated discussion has arisen on the question
whether the account given is to be regarded as true, as wholly a fabrication,
or as belonging to a subsequent voyage and accidentally or intentionally
dated back two years. As this voyage, if actually made as claimed by M.
Varnhagen, would be the first to touch the territory which I denominate the
Pacific States, I find it necessary to give in this place the leading points in
the discussion. In what may be called the standard authorities on American
discovery, such as Navarrete, Humboldt, and others, is found fully presented
the question of the authenticity of Vespucci's voyage, always, however, under
the supposition that the land claimed to have been visited was the coast of
Paria. The theory of M. Varnhagen, that that region must be sought in
North America, reopens the question and introduces some new features which
cannot be passed by unnoticed in this connection. Without entering upon
the somewhat complicated bibliography of Vespucci's narrations, or taking
up the question of his claims in the matter of naming America, I shall attempt
to state briefly, and as clearly as I am able, the arguments for and
against the authenticity of a voyage, in which perhaps is involved the
question of the first post-Scandinavian discovery of the North American
continent.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE DISPUTED VOYAGE OF VESPUCCI.</div>

<p class="blockquot">
Besides Vespucci's own statement, in a letter written in 1504, no contemporary
document has been found which mentions such an expedition, though
most diligent search for such documents has been made in the Spanish archives
by partisans and opponents of the Florentine's claim. This absence of
confirmatory documents is the more noticeable as the expedition was made
under royal patronage. In another and previously written letter describing
his second voyage in 1499, Vespucci not only makes no mention of this
voyage, but even excuses his long silence by saying that nothing had occurred
worth relating. True, a short letter of one Vianello, dated 1506, published
by Humboldt, mentions a voyage to which no date is given, made by Vespucci
in company with Juan de la Cosa. M. Varnhagen supposes this to have
been the voyage in question, and a large river discovered at the time to have
been the Mississippi; but, beside the fact that there is no reason for attributing
the date of 1497 rather than any other to this voyage, Vianello's letter,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_101' href='#Page_101'>101</a></span>
with two others, published by Harrisse, indicates a much later date for the
expedition with Juan de la Cosa.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
Moreover, not only is there a want of original records, but contemporary
historians are silent respecting this expedition; the first mention by later
writers being a denial of its authenticity when it was thought to conflict with
the admiral's claims as discoverer of the continent. Yet, on the supposition
of a voyage to the North American coast, there are some passages in the historians
Peter Martyr, Oviedo, Gomara, and Herrera, which point more or less
definitely to an exploration of the gulf of Honduras before 1502. Peter
Martyr, dec. i. cap. vi., writing before 1508, says that many claim to have
sailed round Cuba; and later, dec. i. cap. x., he mentions a report that
Pinzon and Solis had explored the coast of Honduras, giving, however, no
dates. Oviedo, <i>Hist. Gen.</i>, tom. ii. p. 140, says positively that the gulf of
Honduras was discovered not by Columbus, but by Pinzon and Solis, and
that before the former discovered the Amazon, or the latter the Rio de la
Plata, that is to say before 1499. Gomara, <i>Hist. de las Indias</i>, fol. 63, states
that Pinzon and Solis are said by some to have explored the coast of Honduras
three years before Columbus, which would make it in 1499. Herrera,
<i>Hist. Gen.</i>, dec. iv. lib. viii. cap. iii., says that the gulf of Honduras was
named Hibueras from the gourds found floating in its waters by the first
Spaniards who sailed along the coast. To M. Varnhagen, this it may be random
remark of Herrera is proof positive that as Columbus did not enter or
name the gulf, he was not the first Spaniard who sailed along the coast.
Whatever weight may be attached to these passages from the historians, in
proving a voyage to North America previous to that of the admiral, such evidence
is manifestly increased by the fact that the date of the voyage attributed
to Pinzon and Solis seems to rest entirely on the statement of Herrera,
<i>Hist. Gen.</i>, dec. i. lib. vi. cap. xvi., who describes the expedition with other
events under the date of 1506. Yet in the testimony in the lawsuit hereinafter
to be mentioned, it is implied, though not expressly stated, that the
voyage was after that of Columbus, since special pains was taken by the king
to prove the coast explored by Pinzon to be distinct from that discovered by
the admiral. Another point is that in this same testimony the name 'Caria'
is given to a place visited during Pinzon's voyage, and for this name Vespucci's
'Lariab' may possibly be a misprint.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
Humboldt, <i>Exam. Crit.</i>, tom. iv. pp. 59, 267, 272-4, repeatedly states it
as an undeniable fact that Vespucci was employed in Spain in fitting out the
vessels for the third voyage of Columbus, up to the date of the sailing of the
expedition, May 30, 1498, and consequently could not himself have sailed in
May or any other month of 1497. He makes this statement on the authority
of documents collected by Muñoz. Harrisse, <i>Bib. Am. Vet.</i>, p. 57, states,
also on the authority of Muñoz, that from April, 1497, to May 30, 1498, Vespucci
was "constantly travelling from Seville to San Lúcar." Vespucci is
known to have succeeded Juanoto Berardi, who died in December, 1495, in a
contract to fit out vessels for the Spanish government, and to have received
money on account of that contract on the 12th of January, 1496. Irving,
with access to the documents of Muñoz, says that four caravels fitted out by
Vespucci sailed February 3, 1496, but were driven back; and he speaks of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_102' href='#Page_102'>102</a></span>
no evidence of his presence in Spain in 1497 or 1498. Navarrete, relying on
the same Muñoz documents—which consist of extracts from the books of expenses
of Indian armadas in the Casa de Contratacion in Seville—gives no
date to the sailing and wreck of the four vessels mentioned by Irving, but
implies that the event took place before Berardi's death. After speaking of
the receipt of money on the 12th of January, 1496, he states that Vespucci
"went on attending to everything until the armada was despatched
from San Lúcar." <i>Col. de Viages</i>, tom. iii. p. 317. He does not state that
the fleet thus fitted out was that in which Columbus sailed in 1498. Muñoz
in the printed portion of his work is silent on the subject. Varnhagen, <i>Vespuce
et son Premier Voy.</i>, p. 18, argues that Humboldt had no authority
whatever for applying Navarrete's statement respecting the armada despatched
from San Lúcar to the admiral's fleet, that statement having probably
been his authority, and not the original documents of Muñoz; and that
the four vessels whose fitting-out Vespucci personally superintended were
much more probably those in which he himself sailed and made the voyage
in question. Varnhagen furthermore thinks that the death of Berardi furnished
a reasonable motive for the resolution formed by Vespucci to visit the
Indies, and a favorable opportunity for carrying out his resolution. If it can
be proved that Vespucci was in Spain in 1497 and 1498, of course the question
of his claimed voyage admits of no farther discussion; but if Humboldt's
only authority be his interpretation of Navarrete's statement, even if the interpretation
be not unnatural or improbable, the matter must still be considered
doubtful until the original Muñoz documents are produced.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
The silence of contemporary documents respecting Vespucci's voyage carries
the greater weight from the fact that there are special reasons for the
existence of such documents, if the voyage had been actually made. In 1508
a suit was begun by Diego Colon against the Spanish crown for the government
of certain territory claimed by virtue of the discovery of Paria by his
father, the admiral. The suit continued to 1513, and every effort was made
by the crown to prove a previous discovery of the coast in question; hundreds
of witnesses were examined, and their testimony has been preserved
and published in Navarrete's collection. In this suit Vespucci was not summoned
as a witness, although much of the time in royal employ, having held
the office of <i>piloto mayor</i> from 1508 to his death in 1512. No claim was advanced
for his discovery, although the voyage is stated to have been made
under royal patronage, and by proving its authenticity the crown would
have gained its object. Indeed, Vespucci's name is only mentioned once in
all the testimony, and that as having accompanied Alonso de Ojeda in his
voyage of 1499. That no one of the many witnesses examined knew of Vespucci's
voyage in 1497, if it were a fact, is hardly possible. Not only were
the witnesses silent on the Florentine's expedition, but many of them, including
Ojeda, affirmed that Paria was first discovered by Columbus, and
next afterward by Ojeda himself. Now as Vespucci accompanied Ojeda, the
latter would surely have known of any previous discovery by Vespucci, and
as Ojeda was not friendly to Columbus he certainly would have made the
fact known. Moreover, the admiral's charts and sailing-directions were followed
by Ojeda in his voyage, which would hardly have been done with a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_103' href='#Page_103'>103</a></span>
skilful pilot like Vespucci on board, and one who had visited the coast
before. True, this last point would have little weight if the coast of Paria
was not the region visited by Vespucci, while the other points would be little
if at all affected by the theory that North America was the coast explored.
No other Spanish voyage to the new region was neglected; indeed, to have
so completely disregarded Vespucci's expedition, it must be supposed that
the king not only knew exactly what region he explored, but had a positive
conviction that said region was entirely distinct from Paria; and we have
seen that no such definite opinion was held at the time, but on the contrary,
special pains was taken to prove that the new regions were "all one coast."
When it is considered that Vespucci's voyage, that is the voyage of Pinzon and
Solis, was mentioned in the testimony, the failure to summon the piloto mayor
appears all the more remarkable. What more efficient witness could have
been brought forward? Thus the silence of the testimony in this suit on the
question under discussion, must be deemed something more than mere negative
proof, as it is termed by M. Varnhagen. This gentleman also notes that
only one witness mentions that Vespucci accompanied Ojeda in 1499; but he
does not note that the presence of Vespucci on Ojeda's ships was of no importance
to either party in the suit, while a previous discovery by him was
of the very greatest importance to the crown.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">VESPUCCI'S VOYAGE FURTHER CONSIDERED.</div>

<p class="blockquot">
The date of sailing from Cádiz is given by different editions of Vespucci's
letter as May 10, and May 20, 1497; and of his return as October 1, 15,
and 18, 1499. From these dates two difficulties arise; first, the duration
of the voyage is stated in the letter to have been eighteen months, while the
period between the dates of sailing and return is twenty-nine months; and
again, Vespucci is known to have sailed with Ojeda in May, 1499, that is,
five months before he returned from the voyage in question. One way of
reconciling the first difficulty is to suppose that the author reckoned time by
the Florentine method, then common in familiar correspondence, according
to which the year began the 25th of March. Then in case of a very natural
misprint in the original of May for March, the voyage really began in 1498,
its duration being thus reduced to nineteen months. A more simple method
of removing both difficulties is to suppose a misprint of 1499 for 1498 as the
date of the return; this would reduce the time to seventeen months. Several
later editions have made this change. The edition claimed as original by M.
Varnhagen has the date 1499 according to his translation, and strangely
enough the editor makes no allusion to it in his notes, although in a former
pamphlet he speaks of 1498 as the date of the return. I attach very little
weight to discrepancies in dates in this relation except as evidence
against any intentional deception on the part of Vespucci. Confusion in
dates is common in all relations of the period; and Vespucci's letters were
written hastily, not for publication, and merely to interest his correspondents
by a description of the marvels he had seen in his New World adventures.
It may here be stated that the long and bitterly argued question of the rival
claims of Vespucci and Columbus in the matter of naming America has no
bearing on the present discussion. There is no evidence that the voyage in
question had any influence in fixing the name America; and to pronounce
this expedition not authentic has no tendency to weaken Vespucci's reputation
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_104' href='#Page_104'>104</a></span>
for honesty, which may now be considered fully established; nor do the
arguments against intentional falsification on Vespucci's part tend to prove
the voyage authentic.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
Several coincidences between the narratives of this voyage and that of
Ojeda have led many writers to conclude that both describe the same expedition,
the dates having been accidentally or intentionally changed. Humboldt,
after a careful examination, was convinced that the two voyages were
identical. But when we consider that Humboldt, Navarrete, and Irving
formed their conclusions without a suspicion of a voyage to North America,
and before that question had ever once arisen; that Navarrete severely criticises
Vespucci's narrative as applied to Ojeda's voyage; that two of the
strongest coincidences—the mention of Paria as the coast visited, and the
discovery of a town built over the water like Venice—have no weight in
view of the new theory, since the province is called Lariab in the original
edition, and that method of building was not uncommon in all the tropical
regions of America, it must be admitted that this argument has by itself little
force against the authenticity of Vespucci's voyage.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
The right granted to private individuals by the Spanish government in
April, 1495, to make voyages of discovery at their own expense, subject to
certain regulations, was partially revoked in June, 1497, after Vespucci's
claimed departure. All authorities agree that during this time such private
voyages, or even clandestine expeditions, may have been and probably were
made, of which no records have been preserved. It is argued that Vespucci's
voyage may have been of this number, although claimed to have been made
under royal patronage, and by no means clandestine. It is even suggested
that the revocation of the right of private navigation, brought about by the
influence of Columbus, was purposely delayed until after Vespucci's departure—all
of which proves, if it proves anything, simply that there was
nothing to prevent Vespucci from making the voyage.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
We have seen how certain statements of the old chroniclers may be taken
as indicative of a voyage along the Central American coast previous to that
of Columbus. There are also similar indications in some of the early maps.
Thus Juan de la Cosa's map representing Cuba as an island in 1500 (see <a href="#i-189">page
115</a> this volume) might be accounted for by such a voyage as Vespucci claims
to have made. It will be seen hereafter that early maps show some slight
traces of a knowledge of Florida before its discovery in 1512 (<a href="#i-201">pp. 128-9</a> this
vol.) In the Ruysch map of 1508 (<a href="#i-200">p. 126</a> this vol.) the eastern coast of what
seems to be Cuba is identified by M. Varnhagen with the main-land; in his
opinion the inscription at the north point of that coast refers directly to Vespucci's
expedition, and 'Cape S. Marci' at the southern point may indicate
Vespucci's arrival on Saint Mark's day, especially as his uncle was a priest of
the order of St Mark. If this appears somewhat far-fetched, perhaps more
weight should be attached to the name 'Cape Doffin de Abril' on the southern
point of what may be Florida on the Ptolemy map of 1513 (<a href="#i-204">p. 130</a> this vol.),
for at the end of April Vespucci may, according to his narrative, have been
at that point. On this matter of an early voyage it may be noted that Columbus,
striking the coast at Guanaja Island in 1502 in search of a passage westward,
instead of following westward, as he naturally would have done, at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_105' href='#Page_105'>105</a></span>
least to the head of the gulf of Honduras, turned directly east. A knowledge
on his part that Vespucci had already explored westward and northward
without finding a passage, would account for his actions. But they have already
been satisfactorily accounted for by the fact that he simply proposed
to sail along the sinuosities of the supposed southern coasts of Asia to India,
rather than to penetrate any intervening continent, whose existence he did
not suspect.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">CONCLUSIONS CONCERNING THE VOYAGE OF VESPUCCI.</div>

<p class="blockquot">
In addition to the leading arguments for and against the voyage in question,
the following minor points are urged:
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
It is claimed that the command of such an expedition would not have been
given to a foreigner, and Vespucci did not become a naturalized citizen of
Spain until 1505. But on the other hand, if Vespucci had rendered no other
service to Spain than to have accompanied Ojeda, he would hardly have received
so many favors from the government, especially after having served
four years under the king of Portugal.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
Señor Navarrete finds a difficulty in Vespucci's claim to have brought back
to Spain 222 slaves in the few small vessels under his command. Vespucci
also speaks of Ferdinand as king of Castile, which it was not customary to
do until after Isabella's death.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
The high opinion held of Vespucci during his life by Columbus and his
zealous friends is of little weight, because the admiral's claim to have discovered
the supposed Asiatic continent or islands adjacent thereto was undoubted;
but the favorable opinions expressed by later writers, especially by
Fernando Colon, writing after America was known to be distinct from Asia,
tend to prove that the Florentine made in his lifetime no claim to a voyage
in 1497. Yet the publication and circulation of his letter in several languages,
uncontradicted for years, would indicate its authenticity, unless it be
taken as a sign of carelessness for dates and details so long as they were not
supposed to conflict with the admiral's claims. It must also be remembered
that the same voyager's second, third, and fourth expeditions have all been
disputed and have at last proved authentic.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
M. Varnhagen applies to Vespucci and his men the well-known tradition
related by Sahagun and others of white men who appeared at Pánuco from
the east before the coming of the Spaniards. He also supposes Guerrero, the
soldier found by Cortés at Cozumel, and believed by other authors to have
been a survivor with Aguilar of Valdivia's shipwreck in 1512, to have been
left in Yucatan by Vespucci; but he gives no reason for this belief, except
that Guerrero had married among the natives, and had adopted many of their
customs. By the same writer it is thought much more likely that Cape
Gracias á Dios was named by Vespucci after a long voyage in search of land,
than by Columbus after following the coast a few days and taking possession;
especially as Columbus in his own letter simply mentions his arrival
at the cape, the fact of his having given the name coming from other sources.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
The events of the voyage, and the description of the coast visited by Vespucci
as given in his letter, furnish no evidence whatever for or against the
authenticity of the expedition; but if it be admitted from outside evidence
that the voyage was actually made, and was distinct from that of Ojeda, while
the narrative has nothing except the occurrence of the name Paria in favor
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_106' href='#Page_106'>106</a></span>
of a South American destination, from it may be gathered the following
points in support of the theory that a more northern coast was the one explored.
The course sailed from the Canaries, W. ¼ SW.; the time thirty-seven
days; the distance 1,000 leagues, taking the distance from Lisbon to
the Canaries, 280 leagues, as a scale of measurement; the latitude of the
landing 16°, and longitude 75° west of the Canaries; and the arrival by sailing
up the coast at a province situated in about 23°, and near the tropic of Cancer,
are worthy of consideration, since a series of blunders such as these is hardly
probable. The natives of Lariab were of different language from and hostile
to the nations passed further south, as the Huastecs of the Pánuco region
are known to have been with respect to the Mexicans. Moreover, Lariab
has a slight claim to being a Huastec word, since Orozco y Berra gives three
names of places in that language containing an <i>l</i> and ending in <i>ab</i>; but of
course this would interfere sadly with the theory that Lariab is a misprint
of Caria. Vespucci's description of the natives, criticised by Navarrete as
incorrect when applied to the people of Paria, agrees better, as M. Varnhagen
thinks, with the aborigines of Honduras. Other parts of Vespucci's
vague and rambling descriptions apply well enough to the North American
coasts, or in fact to any part of tropical America, north or south.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
The application of the narrative to North America is not, however, without
its difficulties. Vespucci makes no mention of the Antilles, through which his
course must have led him; perhaps not seeing them by reason of fog; or he had
instructions not to concern himself with what the admiral had already discovered.
He also refers to a larger work, never published, in which details were
to be given. Neither does he mention the prominent peninsulas of Yucatan
and Florida, nor the lofty mountain peaks which he would naturally have seen
in following the Mexican coast. He claims to have sailed north-west from
Pánuco 870 leagues (over dry land?) to the best harbor in the world. M.
Varnhagen's explanation of this difficulty is that Vespucci simply states incidentally
that he left Pánuco "tuttavia verso il Maestrale" still toward the
north-west, not intending to include in this course the whole voyage of 870
leagues. All the windings of the coast and the entering and leaving of many
ports or rivers must be taken into account to make up a distance of 870
leagues between Pánuco and Cape Cañaveral; and the latter port would
hardly be considered the 'best harbor in the world' except by a great stretch
of the imagination, or by a navigator little acquainted with good harbors.
The archipelago of Ity has generally been supposed to be Hayti, but there is
probably no reason for the identity beyond the resemblance of names. The
Bermudas when discovered in 1522 were uninhabited, but this does not prove
that they were always so; the Spaniards may have returned and captured
the people for slaves. Indeed the Bermudas may have been the archipelago
of San Bernardo, famous for its fierce Carib population, but generally located
off the gulf of Urabá. It may even have been named by Vespucci, for on
San Bernardo's day, the 20th of August, he was probably there.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
Thus have I given, and let me hope without prejudice, the arguments for
and against this disputed voyage; and from the evidence the reader may
draw his own conclusions. To me the proofs seem conclusive that Vespucci
made no voyage to South America prior to 1499, when he accompanied
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_107' href='#Page_107'>107</a></span>
Alonso de Ojeda. Against a North American expedition the evidence, if less
conclusive, is still very strong; since the most that can be claimed in its
favor is a probability that the Central American coast was visited by some
navigator before 1502, and a possibility, though certainly a very slim one,
that Vespucci accompanied such navigation.

<div class="sidenote">CABOT AND VASCO DA GAMA.</div>

<p class="p2 blockquot">
[1497.] To continue our chronological summary. Following the brilliant
success of Spain, England was the first nation to attempt discovery to the
westward. Fully acquainted with the achievements and hypotheses of Columbus,
having been indeed almost persuaded by him to embrace his beliefs,
King Henry VII. on the 5th of March, 1496, granted a license to John Cabot,
a Venetian citizen and trader of Bristol, to attempt discoveries in that
direction.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
Either from respect for Portuguese and Spanish rights in the south, or
from some vague hints received from the Northmen during their trading
voyages to Iceland, or possibly from a dim idea of the advantages of great-circle
sailing, the English determined to attempt reaching India by a northern
route. This expedition of Cabot's, with perhaps several vessels, sailed from
Bristol probably in May, 1497; discovered land the 24th of June on the coast
of Labrador between 56° and 58°; sailed some 300 leagues in a direction not
known, but probably northward; and one vessel, the <i>Matthew</i>, returned to
Bristol in August of the same year. No further details of the voyage are
known, and those given, which are the conclusions of Humboldt, Kohl, and
Stevens, have all been disputed in respect to date, commander, and point of
landing. D'Avesac, as we have seen (<a href="#Page_98">pp. 98-9</a>), insists on a previous voyage
in 1494. Biddle, <i>Memoir of Sebastian Cabot</i>, London, 1831, p. 42 et seq., claims
that Sebastian Cabot was the commander. Robinson, <i>Account of Discov. in
the West</i>, Richmond, 1848, pp. 81-93, explains that by a change in the method
of reckoning time after 1752, the date should properly read 1498. Many
authors moreover confound this voyage with a later one. <i>Hakluyt's Voy.</i>, vol.
iii. pp. 4-11;
<i>Galvano's Discov.</i>, pp. 87-9;
<i>Viages Menores</i>, in <i>Navarrete</i>, tom.

The Portuguese, to complete their discovery of the route to India by way
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_108' href='#Page_108'>108</a></span>
of the Cape of Good Hope, sent out Vasco da Gama with four ships. Sailing
from Lisbon July 8, 1497, he doubled the Cape of Good Hope the 22d of November,
passed the limit reached by Dias on the 17th of December, received intelligence
of Prester John at several points on the eastern coast, and anchored at
Calicut May 20, 1498. Trading somewhat, jealous of everybody, after quarrelling
with Arabian merchants and failing to make good his arbitrary measures,
he thought best to return. Accordingly he set sail the 29th of August, passed
the cape March 20, 1499, and reached Lisbon about the end of August. Thus
Gama was the first to accomplish the grand object of so many efforts, and to
reach India by water. His achievement would doubtless have been regarded

<p class="blockquot">
[1498.] After the return of the Cabots in August, 1497, with the news of
having discovered the northern regions of Cathay, King Henry issued a new
patent dated February 3, 1498, and, probably in May of the same year, two
vessels with 300 men sailed from Bristol under command of Sebastian
Cabot. Little is known of the voyage, save that he reached the coast of
Labrador, which he followed northward until at a certain point where the
coast trends eastward he found much ice even in July. This northern limit
is placed by Ramusio at latitude 56°; by Gomara, who states that Cabot himself
gives a much higher latitude, at 58°; by Galvano, at above 60°. Kohl
follows Humboldt in the opinion that it was 67° 30', which would place it on
the Cumberland peninsula. Cabot then turned southward and sailed as near
shore as possible. The southern limit of this voyage is more indefinite than
the northern. In a conversation with Peter Martyr, prior to 1515, Cabot
stated that he reached the latitude of Gibraltar, and the chronicler adds that
he sailed so far west that he had Cuba on his left. Cabot's remark would
place him in latitude 36°, near Cape Hatteras, while Martyr's addition might
apply to any locality on the east coast. Martyr's statement is the only authority
for the supposition by Humboldt and others—see <i>Exam. Crit.</i>, tom. i.
p. 313, and Preface to Ghillany—that Cabot reached Florida. Stevens, <i>Notes</i>,
pp. 17-19 and 35, considers Peter Martyr's remark as absurd, since it would
place Cabot near Cincinnati. He is satisfied that the southern limit was the
gulf of St Lawrence, founding this belief on maps of 1500 (see <a href="#i-189">p. 115</a> this
vol.) and 1508 (<a href="#i-200">p. 126</a> this vol.), 1514, and 1544, the latter said to have been
made by Cabot himself. That Cabot did not reach the southern coast of the
United States seems proved by the fact that he was in Spain from 1513 to
1524, holding high positions, including that of piloto mayor, while that coast
was actually being explored, and he making no claim to a previous discovery.
The point reached, therefore, must remain undetermined between Cape Hatteras,
where Kohl fixes it, and the gulf of St Lawrence, with a strong probability,
as I think, in favor of the latter. Nothing whatever is known of the
route or date of Cabot's return. And it is to be remembered that concerning
this voyage we have only one contemporary document, which is a letter dated
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_109' href='#Page_109'>109</a></span>
in 1498, stating simply that the expedition was still absent. All additional
details are from accounts written after the geography of the New World was
better known in consequence of the discovery of the South Sea. Nothing,
then, can be proved by Cabot's voyages beyond the discovery of the continent
in June, 1497, and the exploration of the coast from the gulf of St Lawrence
to above 60° in 1498. The statement of Asher, <i>Life of Henry Hudson</i>, London,
1860, that Cabot "was the first to recognize that a new and unknown
continent was lying as one vast barrier between western Europe and eastern
Asia," accepted also by Kohl, <i>Hist. Discov.</i>, p. 145, appears to me utterly
without foundation. Cabot's complaint that a new-found land—that is a
land further north and east than any part of Asia described by Polo—was a
barrier to his reaching India, and the fact that on a map made as late as
1544, and doubtfully attributed to him, a separate continent is shown, seem
weak authority for according him so important a discovery, especially when
other voyagers and geographers, intimate with him and fully acquainted
with his discoveries, continued for many years to join those discoveries to the
Asiatic continent. See, beside references on <a href="#Page_107">page 107</a>, <i>Peter Martyr</i>, dec. iii.

<div class="sidenote">THIRD VOYAGE OF COLUMBUS.</div>

<p class="p2 blockquot">
Returned from his second voyage, Columbus found his popularity waning,
and with it the enthusiasm for new discoveries. The voyage had not been
profitable, had not been fruitful enough in gold to satisfy the adventurers
who accompanied him, and the ghastly faces of the mariners more than counteracted
the effect of the specimens of native products exhibited. It was
difficult, therefore, to obtain men for a new enterprise. Still, notwithstanding
the reports of his numerous enemies, the admiral was considerately
treated at court, and finally, by the efforts of the queen, six vessels were
made ready, and Columbus embarked from San Lúcar on a third voyage May
30, 1498. This time he determined to steer farther to the south than before,
in order to reach, as he supposed, the richer parts of Asia. After touching
at Madeira, Porto Santo, and the Canaries, he divided his fleet, sent three
vessels direct to Española, and with the other three reached the Cape
Verde Islands the 27th of June. Thence he sailed first south-west and
west through the region of tropical calms, and then northward to Trinidad
Island, where he arrived the 31st of July. Coasting the island on the
south, in sight of the main-land, he entered the gulf of Paria, landed, and
found much gold of an inferior quality, and an abundance of pearls; from
which circumstance, that land, which was the northern end of South America,
was for some time thereafter known as the Pearl Coast. Passing out by the
Boca del Drago on the 14th of August, he followed the northern coast of Paria
to the island of Cubagua, beginning to suspect meanwhile that the land on his
left was the main-land of Asia. Ill health and the state of his supplies did not
permit him to satisfy himself on that point at the time, and consequently
he turned his course north-west for Española. On the 30th of August he
arrived at the mouth of the river Ozema, where he met his brother Bartolomé,
who informed him of the internal discords and external wars of the colonists.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_110' href='#Page_110'>110</a></span>
Francisco Roldan had refused to submit to the admiral's authority, and on
the 18th of October five ships were despatched for Spain with news of the
rebellion. By this departure Columbus sent letters and charts describing
this Pearl Coast, as his present South American discoveries which yielded so
many gems were called. During the whole year following, peace was maintained
among the colonists only by the most humiliating concessions of Columbus
to Roldan and his crew. On the 5th of September, 1499, Alonso de
Ojeda arrived at Española from the Pearl Coast, whither he had been to take
advantage of the discoveries and misfortunes of the admiral.

<p class="blockquot">
Vessels laden with complaints by and against Columbus were despatched
for Spain in October; needy, ambitious courtiers held King Ferdinand's
willing ear against him; from his persistent advocacy of Indian slave-traffic
the friendship of his patron, Queen Isabella, grew cold; and in July, 1500,
Francisco de Bobadilla was sent to Española with powers to investigate.
Arrived at Santo Domingo August 23, the commissioner assumed at once
authority, which at most was his right only after careful and conscientious
inquiry, seized Columbus and his brother, and in October sent them in irons
to Spain. <i>Colon</i>, <i>Hist. del Almirante</i>, in <i>Barcia</i>, tom. i. pp. 74-99;

<p class="blockquot">
During this third voyage, while about the gulf of Paria, new visions of the
earth's form filled the mind of the great navigator, inflamed as it was by illness
and anxiety. The world was indeed for the most part spherical, as had
been supposed, but in this great central region on the equator he believed
the surface to rise gradually to a great height, making the earth pear-shape
with the terrestrial paradise, or birth-place of man, on its apex, the waters and
islands visited by him being on the borders of this elevated portion. It is
not necessary to enumerate the natural phenomena, scientific writings, and
scripture texts with which he confirmed his theory. In his distracted enthusiasm
he leaves us somewhat uncertain as to his idea of the situation of this
new region with respect to India proper and those parts of Asia found by him
in a former voyage farther north. If he had supposed it to be simply a
southern extension of Marco Polo's Asia, he would not subsequently have
sought for a strait or passage to India to the north rather than to the south
of this point. Gama's successful circumnavigation of Africa forbade a revival
in the mind of Columbus of the old theory of Ptolemy, that Africa extended
east and north so as to enclose the Indian Ocean like an immense gulf. The
admiral's idea, so far as he formed a definite one on the subject, must have
been that of a large island, or detached portion of the Asiatic continent, occupying
very nearly the actual relative position of the Australian archipelago,
and only vaguely included, if at all, in ancient or mediæval knowledge of the
far East. No other conclusion could rationally be drawn from his letters and
subsequent actions; and we shall find such an idea of the geography of these
parts often repeated in following years. We shall also see how unfortunate
it was for the posthumous glory of the great discoverer in the matter of naming
the western world, that he did not more clearly specify his idea of this
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_111' href='#Page_111'>111</a></span>
new land—for I believe this was the first suspicion that new lands of any
considerable extent existed—and that his account of this and his fourth voyage
were not more widely circulated in print.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
[1499.] The discovery of the Pearl Coast, made known in Spain in December,
1498, caused several expeditions to be sent out in the following year.
These were trading and not exploring voyages, and their commanders had no
thought of cosmography, caring little whether Paria were the terrestrial paradise
or the infernal regions, so that pearls, and gold, and slaves were abundant.
No connected journals of these voyages have been preserved, our
knowledge of them being derived from statements of the early historians and
from testimony in the famous lawsuit with the heirs of Columbus, printed
in Navarrete's collection.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">MINOR EXPEDITIONS.</div>

<p class="blockquot">
The first was that of Alonso de Ojeda, who, by the influence of Bishop
Fonseca, the admiral's most bitter enemy, obtained a commission to visit the
Pearl Coast, avoiding, however, lands discovered by the Portuguese and by
Columbus prior to 1495. In company with Juan de la Cosa and Amerigo
Vespucci, Ojeda embarked with four vessels from Santa María, near Cádiz,
on the 20th of May, 1499. Sailing by the admiral's charts, he touched at
the Canaries, and after twenty-four days reached the main-land of South
America between 3° and 6° north latitude—that is according to Ojeda's testimony;
but Vespucci's account of what was probably the same voyage brings
them first upon the continent further south. This is claimed by Varnhagen,
<i>Examen de quelques points de l'histoire géographique du Brazil</i>, Paris, 1858, as
the first discovery of Brazil. Following the coast north-west for 200 leagues
without landing, but discovering the two great rivers Essequebo and Orinoco,
they landed on Trinidad Island, the first inhabited coast which they touched,
where they traded for pearls and found traces of the admiral who had preceded
them. Out through the Boca del Drago, following the coast of Paria
to the gulf of Pearls, or Curiana, landing on Margarita Island, anchoring in
the bay of Corsarios, they continued from port to port to Chichirivichi, where
they had a fight with the natives, and spent twenty days in a port near by.
Ojeda then visited Curazao and the gulf of Venezuela, where was found a
town built over the water like Venice. On the 24th of August he discovered
Lake Maracaibo, and afterward followed the coast westward to Cape de la
Vela, whence he directed his course, on the 30th of August, to Española,
arriving, as we have seen, September 5, 1499. He finally returned to Spain
in the middle of June, 1500, the voyage having yielded but a small profit.

<p class="blockquot">
The second minor expedition to South America was that of Pedro Alonso
Niño and Cristóbal Guerra, similar in its object to that of Ojeda. A few
days after Ojeda's departure they sailed from Palos in one vessel with thirty-three
men, reaching the main-land farther north, and some fifteen days later
than Ojeda. They traded on the coast of Cumaná for three months, their
western limit being the region of Chichirivichi, started for home February 13,
1500, and arrived in Spain about the middle of April with a large quantity of
pearls. <i>Peter Martyr</i>, dec. i. cap. viii.;

<p class="blockquot">
The third expedition of this year was that of Vicente Yañez Pinzon, who
had commanded a vessel under Columbus in 1492. Sailing early in December,
1499, from Palos with a fleet of four vessels he crossed the equator,
and on the 20th of January—Peter Martyr says the 26th, and Irving the 28th
of January—discovered land in latitude 8° south, at Cape St Augustine, which
he named Santa María de la Consolacion. Varnhagen, <i>Examen</i>, pp. 19-24,
entertains doubts regarding the spot where Pinzon first landed, and thinks it
quite as likely to have been some cape further north. From this point,
wherever it may have been, Pinzon followed the coast to the north, touched
at various places, discovered the Amazon, and in due time reached the gulf of
Paria. Thence he sailed through the Boca del Drago, arrived at Española on
the 23d of June, and returned to Spain in September, 1500. This voyage was as
disastrous as the preceding one had been profitable. Peter Martyr states,
dec. i. cap. ix., that Paria was thought to be a part of Asia beyond the Ganges.

<p class="blockquot">
Here belongs Amerigo Vespucci's account of a second voyage made in conjunction
with others in the service of the king of Spain. Departing in May,
1499—some editions of his letters have it 1489—from Cádiz and touching at
the Canaries he steered south-west for nineteen days, sailing in that time
500 leagues to a point on the main-land in latitude 5° south,—from
incorrect readings of the originals some editors make him say 800 leagues
and latitude 8°—where the days and nights are equal on the 27th of June, at
which time the sun enters Cancer. Thence coasting eastward forty leagues;
then north-west to a beautiful island and convenient harbor; and yet eighty
other leagues to a secure harbor where he remained seventeen days and gathered
many pearls; thence to another port; then to an island fifteen leagues
from the main-land; and again to another island, which was called Gigantes,
where captives were taken; then to a fine bay where the ships were refitted;
and finally, after forty-seven days at this last place they sail for Antilla, that
is Española. Two months and two days are spent at Antilla, whence on the
22d of July they embark for Spain, and reach Cádiz September 8, 1500.

letter in <i>Navarrete</i>, <i>Col. de Viages</i>, tom. iii. pp. 242-62.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
It has never been claimed that Vespucci attempted discoveries in 1499 as
chief in command. The voyage described by him is without doubt that of
Pinzon or Ojeda, although D'Avesac, in <i>Bulletin de la Soc. Géog.</i>, makes it
identical with that of Lepe. Humboldt, <i>Exam. Crit.</i>, tom. iv. pp. 200 et seq.,
by comparing the details decides that it was that of Pinzon, and by the same
method he concludes that Vespucci's first voyage was that under Ojeda. As
the points of resemblance are slight in either case; as Vespucci is known to
have accompanied Ojeda; as he would have been obliged to return to Spain
before Ojeda in June, 1500, in order to sail with Pinzon in December, 1499;
and as Vespucci describes an astronomical phenomenon which, as Humboldt
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_113' href='#Page_113'>113</a></span>
admits, could not possibly have taken place during Pinzon's voyage, I am
inclined to accept the generally received opinion that Ojeda's is the voyage
described. "There can now be no doubt that Vespucci's voyage in 1499 was
identical with that of Ojeda." <i>Major's Prince Henry</i>, p. 370;
<i>Varnhagen</i>,
<i>Exam.</i>, pp. 1-19. Navarrete and Irving imply that this was the only voyage
made by Vespucci for the crown of Spain. However it may be, for the
purposes of this Summary the question is of little importance; for there are
no disputed points of geographical import depending on the two trading
voyages, one of which Vespucci attempts to describe; and if there were, his
account in the different forms in which it exists is so full of blunders that it
could throw but little light upon the subject.

<p class="blockquot">
The fourth minor expedition of this year was that of Diego de Lepe, who
sailed in less than a month after Pinzon—that is near the end of December,
1499—with two vessels. Touching main-land below Cape St Augustine, he
observed the south-western trend of the coast below that point; but of his
voyage along the shore nothing is known save that he reached the Pearl Coast.

that such a voyage was made, although Ojeda reported that he found several

<p class="blockquot">
The year following the return of Gama from his successful voyage to India,
Pedro Alvarez Cabral was entrusted with the command of thirteen well-armed
vessels, and sent to establish commercial relations with the new
countries now made accessible to Portuguese enterprise. Cabral embarked
from Lisbon on the 9th of March, 1500; thirteen days later he left behind
him the Cape Verde Islands, pursuing a south-westerly course. Whether he
was driven by storms in this direction, or wished to avoid the calms of the
Guinea coast, or whether he entertained a hope of reaching some part of the
regions recently discovered by the Spaniards is not known. Certain it is,
however, that notwithstanding his having sailed for India, on the 22d of
April—Humboldt says in February—he found himself on the coast of Brazil
in about latitude 10° south, leaving a gap probably of some 170 leagues between
this point and the southern limit of Lepe and Pinzon. Thence he
coasted southward, took formal possession of the land on the 1st of May at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_114' href='#Page_114'>114</a></span>
Porto Seguro, and named the country Vera Cruz, which name soon became
Santa Cruz. Cabral immediately sent Gaspar de Lemos in one of the ships
back to Portugal with an account and map of the new discoveries. Leaving
two convicts with the natives of that coast, Cabral continued his journey for
India on the 22d of May. Off the Cape of Good Hope he lost four vessels,
in one of which was Bartolomeu Dias, the discoverer of the cape, and reached
Calicut on the 13th of September. Returning he met at Cape Verde a fleet,
on board of which is supposed to have been Amerigo Vespucci, and arrived
at Lisbon July 23, 1501. <i>Navigation del Capitano Pedro Alvares</i>, in <i>Ramusio</i>,

The Portuguese did not overlook the north while making their important
discoveries to the south. Two vessels, probably in the spring of 1500, were
sent out under Gaspar Cortereal. No journal or chart of the voyage is now in
existence, hence little is known of its object or results. Still more dim is a
previous voyage ascribed by Cordeiro to João Vaz Cortereal, father of Gaspar,
about the time of Kolno, which, as Kunstmann views it, "requires further
proof." Touching at the Azores, Gaspar Cortereal, possibly following Cabot's
charts, struck the coast of Newfoundland north of Cape Race, and sailing
north discovered a land which he called Terra Verde, perhaps Greenland, but
was stopped by ice at a river which he named Rio Nevado, whose location
is unknown. Cortereal returned to Lisbon before the end of 1500. <i>Cancellieri</i>,

that Terra Verde was not Greenland.

In October of this same year Rodrigo de Bastidas sailed from Cádiz with
two vessels. Touching the shore of South America near Isla Verde, which lies
between Guadalupe and the main-land, he followed the coast westward to El
Retrete, or perhaps Nombre de Dios, on the isthmus of Darien, in about 9° 30'
north latitude. Returning, he was wrecked on Española toward the end of
1501, and reached Cádiz in September, 1502. This being the first authentic

Of the many manuscript maps and charts made by navigators prior to this
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_115' href='#Page_115'>115</a></span>
time none have been preserved. In the year 1500, however, a map of the
world was made by the veteran pilot Juan de la Cosa, who had sailed with
Columbus on his second voyage, and had accompanied Alonso de Ojeda to the
Pearl Coast. It is preserved in the Royal Library of Madrid, and shows in

All the newly found regions are represented as parts of Asia, and consequently
names are applied only to islands and particular localities. Up to
this time three portions of the supposed Asiatic seaboard have been explored.
First, there are the discoveries of the Cabots in the north, represented as extending
from 'Cabo de Yngleterra' westward to the flag which bounds the
'Sea discovered by the English.' This direct western trend of the coast,
most likely laid down from Cabot's charts, is one of the strongest evidences
that the coast explored by Cabot was the northern shore of the gulf of St
Lawrence. Another reason for entertaining such belief is the use of the
words <i>Mar descubierta por Yngleses</i> instead of <i>Mare Oceanus</i>, thus indicating
that it was a sea or gulf and not the open ocean. Cosa could not at the time
have known the results of Cortereal's voyage. On Cabot's coast various
points are named, but farther to the north-east and to the south-west the line
is laid down indefinitely and without names, probably from Marco Polo.
Kohl puts the inscription <i>Mar descubierta</i>, etc., farther south and west than
on the original, and thinks the curve in the coast west of the last flag to be
Cape Cod. Then we have in the south the northern coast of South America
quite accurately laid down from Cape de la Vela south-eastward to the limit
of Pinzon's voyage in 1499; with a nameless coast-line south-east to the locality
of Cape St Augustine. From Cape de la Vela we have the same imaginary
coast-line without names extending westward, as if to meet the line from the
north-east; but just at the point where the lines must meet, or be separated
by a strait leading to India proper, the non-committal map-maker inserted a
picture—indicated by the double dotted lines—thus avoiding the expression
of his opinion as to whether the Pearl Coast was joined to Asia, or was
detached from the continent. On the original map no attempt is made
to show inland topography, although the copies of Humboldt and Kohl have
some lakes and rivers. I have taken the liberty to indicate the indefinite,
nameless coasts by a dotted line for greater clearness. The last of the three
several explored regions shown by this map are the central islands, Cuba,
Española, and others discovered by Columbus, who was accompanied in at
least one of his voyages by the author himself. In this part of the map some
difficulty has arisen from the fact that Cuba is represented as an island, while
Columbus is known to have held the opinion that it was a part of the mainland;
an opinion, as before stated, which was subscribed to under oath by all
his men, including Juan de la Cosa. On the original, the western part of
Cuba is cut off by green paint, the conventional sign of <i>terra incognita</i>,
which leads Stevens to infer that the pilot "did not intend to represent Cuba
to be an island," but that he only supposed it to be such. This, however, by
no means implies that the draughtsman intended to say that Cuba was not
an island, but rather that he was not certain that it was an island, but only
supposed it to be. It will be remembered that the natives affirmed from the
first that it was an island, although so large that no one had ever reached
its western extremity. This statement, together with his own observations
during the voyage, probably caused Juan de la Cosa to afterward change the
opinion to which he had perhaps hastily subscribed at the request of Columbus.
There can be but little doubt of the authenticity of this map, although
Stevens considers it has been distorted in the various copies and descriptions.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_117' href='#Page_117'>117</a></span>
That the author did not himself make any later additions to it is evident from
the fact that his own subsequent discoveries are not shown.

<p class="blockquot">
[1501.] Again King Henry of England issues commissions permitting
private persons to make discovery at their own expense. So far as known,
however, no voyage was effected under this royal encouragement, although it
is not improbable that intercourse with Newfoundland was continued after
Cabot's discovery. <i>Kunstmann</i>, <i>Entdeckung Am.</i>, p. 55;

The Portuguese, more practical in their attempts, push discovery in all
directions. Juan de Nova with four vessels sails from Lisbon March 5, 1501,
doubles the Cape of Good Hope, and returning reaches Lisbon September 11,
1502, having discovered Ascension Island on the voyage out, and St Helena
on the return. <i>Galvano's Discov.</i>, pp. 97-8;

properly be called voyages of discovery; hence of the frequent subsequent
voyages of the Portuguese to India I shall make no mention except
of such as in some way relate to America. For a summary of these later
voyages see <i>Major's Prince Henry</i>, pp. 413-18.

<p class="blockquot">
Gaspar Cortereal this year makes a second voyage to the regions of the north,
sailing from Belem, near Lisbon, May 15, 1501, with two or three vessels,
touching probably at some point in Newfoundland, and coasting northward
some six or seven hundred miles. He does not, however, reach the Terra Verde
of the former voyage on account of ice. One of the vessels—Kunstmann says
two—returned, arriving at Lisbon October 8, 1501; the other with the commander
was never afterward heard from. One of the chief objects of this
expedition seems to have been the capture of slaves. The name Labrador
is applied by Cortereal to this discovery, "and is perhaps the only permanent
trace of Portuguese adventure within the limits of North America."

The Portuguese also send an expedition to prosecute the discoveries begun
by Cabral, who has not yet returned from India, but whose discovery of
Brazil has been reported by Lemos. Strangely enough no documents exist
in the Portuguese archives touching this voyage, nor is the name of its commander
known, although Varnhagen thinks it may have been Manuel. It is
known as Vespucci's third voyage, and its incidents are found only in his
letters. The authenticity of this as of his other voyages has been often
doubted and denied, and as it is the voyage that resulted in the naming of
America, it has given rise to much discussion, into which however I shall not
enter. The discussion does not affect the voyage itself, nor the leading facts
connected with it, the questions being whether Vespucci was in command,
which indeed he does not claim to have been; and above all, whether
the results of the voyage entitled him to the honor of naming America, which
they certainly did not, even had he commanded, from the fact that other
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_118' href='#Page_118'>118</a></span>
navigators had discovered both of the Americas before him. Navarrete, one
of Vespucci's most jealous enemies, admits that he visited the coast of Brazil
in a subordinate capacity in some Portuguese expedition; and Humboldt, in
an essay of 115 pages, effectually defends the veracity of Vespucci in his
accounts of his voyages, which the distinguished commentator quotes with
notes on the variations of different editions.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
Vespucci was induced to leave Seville in order to accompany the fleet,
which consisted of three vessels—some editions say ten, some fourteen—and
which sailed from Lisbon on the 13th of May. Passing the Canaries without
landing, to the African coast and Basilica in 14°, probably Cape Verde, there
he remained eleven days. At this place he met Cabral's fleet returning from
India and learned the particulars of the voyage, including the American discoveries,
of which he gives a full account in a letter written at the time under
date of June 4, 1501, which is a strong proof of the veracity of his other
accounts. See extracts in <i>Humboldt</i>, <i>Exam. Crit.</i>, tom. v. pp. 34-44. It is
extraordinary that in the several accounts of this meeting the name of Vespucci's
commander is not mentioned. From Cape Verde the fleet sailed
south-west sixty-seven days and touched the main-land the 17th of August, at
a point in 5° south latitude, taking possession for the king of Portugal. Thence
it followed the coast south-east, doubled Cape St Augustine, and went on in
sight of land for 600 leagues to a point in 32° south—according to Gomara,
40°; Navarrete thinks it could not have been over 26°. Having found no
precious metals during a voyage of ten months, the Portuguese abandoned
this coast on the 13th (or 15th) of February, 1502, and after having been
driven by storms far to the south-east, and discovering some land whose
identity is uncertain—Humboldt thinks it was an accumulation of ice, or
the coast of Patagonia—they reached the coast of Ethiopia on the 10th of
May, the Azores toward the end of July, and Lisbon September 7, 1502.
Vespucci gives full descriptions of the natives of Brazil, but these descriptions,
together with the numerous conflicting statements, or blunders of the
various texts relating to details of the voyage, I pass over as unimportant to
my purpose. That Vespucci was with a Portuguese fleet which in 1501-2
explored a large but ill-defined portion of the Brazilian coast, there can be
no doubt. <i>Grynæus</i>, <i>Novus Orbis</i>, pp. 122-30;

In January, 1502, Alonso de Ojeda with four vessels departed from Cádiz
on a second voyage to the Pearl Coast, with the intention of there establishing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_119' href='#Page_119'>119</a></span>
a colony. Accompanied by Garcia de Ocampo, Juan de Vergara, Hernando
de Guevara, and his nephew Pedro de Ojeda, he touched at the Canaries
and Cape Verde Islands, and reached the gulf of Paria. Refitting his vessels,
on the 11th of March he set sail and coasted north-westward, touching
at various points until he came to a port which he called Santa Cruz, probably
Bahía Honda, about twenty-five miles east of Cape de la Vela. During the
voyage along the coast the vessels were much of the time separated, following
different courses. At Santa Cruz Ojeda found a man who had been left
by Bastidas, and there he determined to establish his colony. A fort was
built, and a vessel sent to Jamaica for supplies; but the colony did not prosper.
To other troubles were added dissensions among the fiery leaders, and about
the end of May Ojeda was imprisoned by his companions; the colony was
finally abandoned, and its governor brought as a prisoner to Española in September.
The few disputed points of this voyage concern only the personal

On the eleventh of May, 1502, Columbus embarked from Cádiz on his
fourth and last voyage. Refitting at Española, he directed his course westward,
discovered <i>terra firma</i> at the Guanaja Islands, off the north coast of
Honduras, and sailing southward, followed the shores of the supposed Asia
to El Retrete on the isthmus of Darien, where terminated the discovery of
Bastidas from the opposite direction, whose chart may have been in the admiral's

Since the admiral's discovery, in 1498, of the Pearl Coast, that is, the extreme
northern shore of South America, nothing had occurred to modify his
views formed at that time concerning the new regions, except to show that
this southern addition of the Asiatic continent was much larger than had at
first been supposed. His special aim in this fourth voyage was to do what
various circumstances had prevented him from doing before, namely, to sail
along the eastern and southern coasts of Asia to India, passing, of course,
through the supposed strait between the main-land and the land of Paria.
It is certainly extraordinary that this idea entertained by Columbus corresponded
so closely with the actual conformation of the eastern Asiatic coast,
and its southern addition of the Australian archipelago; that this conformation
is so closely duplicated in the American coasts; and that the position of
the admiral's hypothetical strait was almost identical with the actual narrowest
part of the American continent. Columbus followed the coast to the
western limit of Bastidas' voyage and could find no opening in the shore,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_120' href='#Page_120'>120</a></span>
either because the ancient chroniclers were faulty in making no mention of
this great supposed southern extension of Asia, or because the strait had
in some way escaped his scrutiny. He therefore abandoned the search, and
gave himself up to other schemes, but he never relinquished his original idea,
and died, 1506, in the belief that he had reached the coast of Asia, and without
the suspicion of a new continent. Moreover, his belief was shared by
all cosmographers and scholars of the time. <i>Peter Martyr</i>, dec. i. cap. viii.;

In 1503 the Portuguese sent a third fleet of six vessels under Gonzalo
Coelho to make farther explorations on the coast of Brazil, then called Santa
Cruz, and to sail, if possible, around its southern extremity to India, an idea
that seems to have been conceived during the preceding voyage, but which
could not then be carried into effect for want of supplies. Vespucci commanded
one of the vessels, and set out with high hopes of accomplishing great
things for his country, his God, and himself. This is known as Vespucci's
fourth voyage. Beyond the account which he gives in his letters, little is
known of it except the fact that Coelho made such a voyage at the time.
The identity of the two expeditions has not been undisputed, but Humboldt
and Major both show that there can be little doubt in the matter. The fleet
sailed from Lisbon on the 10th of June—Vespucci says May—remained twelve
or thirteen days at the Cape Verde Islands, and thence sailed south-east to within
sight of Sierra Leone. The navigators were prevented by a storm from anchoring,
and so directed their course south-west for 300 leagues to a desert
island in about lat. 3° south, supposed to be Fernando de Noronha, where
Coelho lost his ship on the 10th of August. Vespucci's vessel was separated
from the rest for eight days, but afterward joined one of them, and the two
sailed south-west for seventeen days, making 300 leagues, and arriving at the
Bahía de Todos os Santos. Remaining there two months and four days, they
followed the coast for 260 leagues to the port now called Cape Frio, where
they built a fort and left twenty-four men who had belonged to the vessel
which had been wrecked. In this port, which by Vespucci's observations
was in lat. 18° south and 35° (or 57°) west of Lisbon, they remained five
months, exploring the interior for forty leagues; they then loaded with Brazil-wood,
and after a return voyage of seventy-seven days arrived in Lisbon
June 28 (or 18), 1504. Vespucci believed the other ships of the fleet to have
been lost, but after his account was written, Coelho returned with two ships;
nothing, however, is now known of his movements after the separation. <span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_121' href='#Page_121'>121</a></span>

[1504.] Soon after the return from his third voyage, Vespucci wrote a

been printed, but no copies are known to exist, and the original is lost.
Translations were made, however, into Latin and German, which appeared in
small pamphlet form in at least seventeen different editions before 1507, under
the title of <i>Mundus Novus</i>, or its equivalent. The earliest edition which
bears a date is that of 1504, but of the nine issues without date, some undoubtedly
appeared before that year. It is probable that other editions have
disappeared on account of their undurable form. None of Vespucci's other

Yucatan, in search of the passage which was still believed to exist between

<div class="sidenote">THE NAMING OF AMERICA.</div>

<p class="blockquot">
<i>Hylacomylus (Waldsee-Müller)</i>, <i>Cosmographiæ Introdvctio ... Insuper quatuor
Americi Vespucij Nauigationes</i>, Deodate (St Dié, Lorraine), 1507, is the
title of a work which appeared four times in the same place and year. It is
the first collection of Vespucci's four voyages, and generally regarded as the
first edition of the first and fourth, although as we have seen M. Varnhagen
claims an Italian edition of the first in 1506. This account of the third
voyage is different from that so widely circulated before as <i>Mundus Novus</i>.
Three other editions of the work, or of the part relating to Vespucci, appeared
in 1509 and 1510. In <i>Hylacomylus</i> the following passage occurs:
"But now that those parts have been more extensively examined, and another
fourth part has been discovered by Americus (as will be seen in the
sequel), I do not see why we should rightly refuse to name it America,
namely, the land of Americus or America, after its discoverer, Americus, a
man of sagacious mind, since both Europe and Asia took their names from
women." Here we have the origin of the name 'America.' To the northern
discoveries of Columbus, Cabot, and Cortereal, on the islands and coast of the
supposed Asia, no general name was given because those regions were already
named India, Cathay, Mangi, etc., while names were applied by Europeans
only to particular places on the new coasts. When Columbus in 1498 explored
the northern coast of South America he had no doubt it was a portion,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_124' href='#Page_124'>124</a></span>
though probably a detached portion, of Asia, and the terms Paria and the
Pearl Coast sufficed to designate the region during the succeeding trading
voyages. Concerning these voyages, only a letter of Columbus and a slight
account of Pinzon's expedition had been printed, apparently without attracting
much attention. The voyages of Columbus, Bastidas, and Pinzon along
the coast of Central America were almost unknown. Meanwhile the fame of
the great navigator had become much obscured. His enterprises on the supposed
Asiatic coast had been unprofitable to Spain. The eyes of the world were
now directed farther south. By the Portuguese the coasts of Brazil had been
explored for a long distance, proving the great extent of this south-eastern
portion of the supposed Asia, whose existence was not indicated on the old
charts, and which certainly required a name. These Portuguese explorations
and their results were known to the world almost exclusively by the letter of
Vespucci so often printed. To the Latin translation of the letter, the name
<i>Mundus Novus</i> had been applied, meaning not necessarily a new continent,
but simply the newly found regions. The name 'America' suggested itself
naturally, possibly through the influence of some friend who was an admirer
of Vespucci, to the German professor of a university in Lorraine, as appropriate
for the new region, and he accordingly proposed it. Having proposed
it, his pride and that of his friends—a clique who had great influence over the
productions of the German press at that period—was involved in securing its
adoption. No open opposition seems to have been made, even by the Portuguese
who had applied the name 'Santa Cruz' to the same region; still it was
long before the new name replaced the old ones. In later years, when
America was found to be joined to the northern continent, and all that great
land to be entirely distinct from Asia, the name had become too firmly fixed
to be easily changed, and no effort that we know of was made to change it.
Later still some authors, inadvertently perhaps, attributed the first discovery
to Vespucci. This aroused the wrath of Las Casas and others, and a discussion
ensued which has lasted to the present time. See list of partisans on
both sides in <i>Harrisse</i>, <i>Bib. Am. Vet.</i>, pp. 65-7. Muñoz and Navarrete insist
that Vespucci was an impostor, but others, headed by Humboldt, have proved
conclusively that the name 'America' was adopted as the result of the somewhat
strange combination of circumstances described, without any intentional
wrong to Columbus. This conclusion is founded chiefly on the following
reasons, namely: The honor to Vespucci resulted chiefly from his third voyage
in 1501, and not from his first voyage in 1497, which last mentioned is
the only one possible to have claimed precedence over Columbus in the discovery
of the continent. Furthermore, neither Columbus nor Vespucci ever
suspected that a new continent had been found; and to precede Cabot in
reaching Asia, Vespucci, even if relying on his first voyage, must have dated
it somewhat earlier in 1497 than he did; while to precede Columbus he must
have dated it before 1492, when, as they both believed, Columbus had touched
Asia at Cuba. Then, again, there is no evidence whatever that Vespucci ever
claimed the honor of discovery. He was on intimate terms with the admiral
and his friends, and is highly spoken of by all, especially by Fernando Colon,
who was extremely jealous in every particular which might affect his father's
honor. Moreover, it is certain that Vespucci did not himself propose the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_125' href='#Page_125'>125</a></span>
name 'America;' it is not certain that he even used the term Mundus Novus
or its equivalent in his letters; and it is quite possible that he never even
knew of his name being applied to the New World, since the name did not
come into general use until many years after his death, which occurred in
1512. The most serious charge which in my opinion can be brought against
Vespucci is neglect—perhaps an intentional deception for the purpose of giving
himself temporary prominence in the eyes of his correspondent—in failing
to name the commanders under whom he sailed; and with exaggeration and
carelessness in his details. But it is to be remembered that his writings were
simply letters to friends describing in familiar terms the wonders of his voyages,
with little care for dry dates and names, reserving particulars for a large
work which he had prepared, but which has never come to light. "After
all," says Irving, "this is a question more of curiosity than of real moment
... about which grave men will continue to write weary volumes, until the
subject acquires a fictitious importance from the mountain of controversy
heaped upon it." <i>Cancellieri</i>, <i>Notizie di Colombo</i>, pp. 41-8;

of text and an engraved map by Johann Ruysch—the first ever published
which includes the New World. Copies have been printed by Lelewel in his
<i>Géog. du moyen âge</i>, atlas; by Santarem, in his <i>Recherches</i>, Paris, 1842, atlas;
and by Humboldt, Kohl, and Stevens. I have taken the annexed copy

This map follows closely that of Juan de la Cosa in 1500, but illustrates
more clearly the geographical idea of the time. The discoveries of Cabot,
whom Ruysch is supposed to have accompanied, as well as those of Cortereal
in the north, of Greenland, Labrador, and Newfoundland, are laid down with
tolerable accuracy; and the rest of the supposed Asiatic coast as in Behaim's
globe is taken from Marco Polo. In the centre we have the lands discovered
by Columbus, and the old fabulous island of Antilia restored. To 'Spagnola'
(Española) is joined an inscription stating the compiler's belief that it was
identical with Zipangu, or Japan. Western Cuba is cut off by a scroll, instead
of by green paint as in the map of Juan de la Cosa, with an inscription to the
effect that this was the limit of Spanish exploration. Ruysch, having as yet
no knowledge of Ocampo's voyage performed during this same year, evidently
entertained the same idea respecting Cuba that was held by Juan de la Cosa,
but did not venture to proclaim it an island. In the south, the New World
is shown under the name 'Terra Sanctæ Crucis sive Mvndvs Novvs.' An open
sea separates the New World from Asia, showing that Ruysch did not know
of the unsuccessful search for this passage by Columbus, Bastidas, and
Pinzon. It is worthy of remark that the name America is not used by this
countryman of Hylacomylus. Humboldt thinks that he had not seen the

Columbus, and his relations are consequently of great value. This work contains

<p class="blockquot">
The map shows only Spanish discoveries, but it is by far the most accurate
yet made. Cuba, now proved to be an island, is so laid down. No name is
given to the Mundus Novus, which, by a knowledge of the Spanish voyages,
is made to extend much farther north and west than in Ruysch's map; but
above the known coasts a place is left open where the passage to India it was
believed might yet be found. The representation of a country, corresponding
with Florida, to the north of Cuba, under the name of 'Isla de Beimini,' may
indicate that Florida had been reached either by Ocampo in 1508, by some
private adventurer, as Diego Miruelo, who is said to have preceded Ponce de
Leon, or, as is claimed by some, by Vespucci in his pretended voyage of 1497;
but more probably this region was laid down from the older maps—see <a href="#i-167">Behaim's
map, p. 93</a>—and the name was applied in accordance with the reports
among the natives of a wonderful country or island, which they called <i>bimini</i>,
situated in that direction. The map is not large enough to show exactly the
relation which Peter Martyr supposed to exist between these regions and the
rest of the world, but the text of the first decade leaves no doubt that he
still believed them to be parts of Asia.

The <i>Ptolemy</i> of 1511 has a map which I have not seen, but which from
certain descriptions resembles that of Ruysch, except that it represents Terra
Corterealis as an island separated from the supposed Asiatic coast; the name
Sanctæ Crucis for South America being still retained. As long as the new
lands were believed to be a part of Asia, the maps bore some resemblance to
the actual countries intended to be represented, but from the first dawning
of an idea of separate lands we shall see the greatest confusion in the efforts
of map-makers to depict the New World. <i>Harrisse</i>, <i>Bib. Am. Vet.</i>, no. 68;

[1512.] The West India Islands, in which the Spaniards are at length
firmly established, become now the point of new departures. Conquerors
and discoverers henceforth for the most part sail from Española or Cuba
rather than from Spain. Juan Ponce de Leon, a wealthy citizen who had
been governor of Puerto Rico, fitted out three vessels at his own expense,
and sailed in search of a fountain, which according to the traditions of the
natives had the property of restoring youth, and which was situated in the
land called Bimini far to the north. This infatuation had been current in
the Islands for several years, and, as we have seen, the name was applied to
such a land on Peter Martyr's map of 1511. Sailing from Puerto Rico
March 3, 1512, Ponce de Leon followed the northern coast of Española, and
thence north-west through the Bahamas, reaching San Salvador on the 14th
of March. Thirteen days thereafter he saw the coast of Florida, so named
by him from the day of discovery, which was Pascua Florida, or Easter-day.
The native name of the land was Cautio. On the 2d of April the Spaniards
landed in 30° 8', and took possession for the king of Spain; then following the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_129' href='#Page_129'>129</a></span>
coast southward they doubled Cape Corrientes (Cañaveral) May 8, and advanced
to an undetermined point on the southern or eastern coast, which
Kohl thinks may have been Charlotte Bay. All this while they believed the
country to be an island. On the 14th of June Ponce de Leon departed from
Florida, and on his return touched at the Tortugas, at the Lucayos, at Bahama,
and at San Salvador, arriving at Puerto Rico the 21st of September.
He left behind one vessel under Juan Perez de Ortubia, who arrived a few
days later with the news of having found Bimini, but no fountain of youth.

his companions were made captives by the natives. Some were sacrificed to
the gods, and then eaten; only two, Gonzalo Guerrero and Gerónimo de Aguilar,
survived their many hardships, the latter being rescued by Cortés in 1519.

Asia. This southern land is called 'Terra Incognita,' with an inscription

fact that its supposed author proposed the name America in honor of Vespucci
only the year before. In fact the map is in many respects incoherent, and is

under Sebastian Cabot and Sir Thomas Pert; but so faint was the heart of
the baronet that the voyage "toke none effect." On this authority some
authors have ascribed a voyage to Cabot in 1517, to regions concerning which
they do not agree. An expedition whose destination and results are unknown,
can have had little effect on geographical knowledge; and Kohl, after a full

Francisco Hernandez de Córdoba, with three vessels and 110 men,

to make explorations toward the west. Touching at Cape Catoche, in Yucatan,
he coasted the peninsula in fifteen days to Campeche, and six days later
reached Potonchan, or Champoton, where a battle was fought with the natives,
and the Spaniards defeated. Accounts indicate that the explorers were not
unanimous in supposing Yucatan to be an island, as it was afterward represented
on some maps. Failing to procure a supply of water in the slough of
Lagartos, Córdoba sailed across the Gulf to Florida, and thence returned to
Cuba, where he died in ten days from his wounds. I find nothing to show

April 8, 1518, with four vessels, reached the island of Santa Cruz (Cozumel)
on the 3d of May, took possession on the 6th of May, and shortly after entered
Ascension Bay. From this point he coasted Yucatan 270 leagues, by his
estimate, to Puerto Deseado, entered and named the Rio de Grijalva (Tabasco),
and took possession of the country in the vicinity of Vera Cruz about the
19th of June. Advancing up the coast to Cabo Rojo, he turned about and
entered Rio Tonalá, engaged in a parting fight at Champoton, followed the
coast for several weeks, and then turned for Cuba, arriving at Matanzas

From the fact that Yucatan is represented as a peninsula, though not
named, while the discoveries of Grijalva and Cortés are not shown, the date
of 1518 may be ascribed to the map. Stevens believes it to have been made
some time about 1514; Kohl about 1520; Kunstmann some time after 1511.
Unexplored coasts are left out instead of being laid down from old Asiatic

to Florida (Bimini), and the Gulf coast from Florida to Yucatan. In the central
region the names 'Terram Antipodum' and 'Antilhas de Castela' are used
without any means of deciding to exactly what parts they are to be applied.
The South Sea discovered by Balboa in 1513 is here shown for the first time
with the inscription 'Mar visto pelos Castelhanus.' To South America the
name 'Brasill' is given. The presence of two Mahometan flags in locations
corresponding to Honduras and Venezuela, shows that the compiler still had
no doubt that he was mapping parts of Asia. <i>Kunstmann</i>, <i>Entdeckung Am.</i>, pp.

year, under Camargo). Prevented by winds and shoals from coasting

reached was the gulf of San Lúcar (Nicoya), latitude 10° north, in Nicaragua,

We have seen several unsuccessful attempts by both Spaniards and Portuguese
to find a passage to India by the southern parts of Brazil, Santa Cruz,
or America. In 1519 a native of Oporto, Fernando de Magalhaens, called by
Spaniards Magallanes, and by English authors Magellan, after having made
several voyages for Portugal to India <i>via</i> Good Hope, quit the Portuguese
service dissatisfied, entered the service of Spain, and undertook the oft-repeated
attempt of reaching the east by sailing west. His particular destination
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_135' href='#Page_135'>135</a></span>
was the Moluccas, which the Spaniards claimed as lying within the hemisphere
granted to them by the treaty of Tordesillas in 1494. It appears that
Magellan had seen some map, of unknown origin, on which was represented
a strait instead of an open sea at the southern point of America—probably
the conjecture of some geographer, for, says Humboldt, "dans le moyen
âge les conjectures étaient inscrits religieusement sur les cartes." See <i>Exam.
Crit.</i>, tom. i. pp. 306, 326, 354; tom. ii. pp. 17-26. Sailing from San Lúcar
September 20, 1519, with five ships and 265 men, he reached Rio de Janeiro
on the coast of Brazil on the 13th of December, and from that point coasted
southward. An attempt to pass through the continent by the Rio de la Plata
failed, and on March 31, 1520, the fleet reached Port St Julian in about 49° south,
where it remained five months until the 24th of August. On the 21st of October
Magellan arrived at Cabo de las Vírgenes and the entrance to what seemed,
and indeed proved, to be the long-desired strait. Having lost one vessel on
the eastern coast, and being deserted by another which turned back and sailed
for Spain after having entered the strait, with the remaining three he passed
on, naming the land on the south Tierra del Fuego, from the fires seen burning
there. Emerging from the strait, which he called Vitoria after one of
his ships, on the 27th of November he entered and named the Pacific Ocean.
Then steering north-west for warmer climes he crossed the line February 13,
1521, arrived at the Ladrones on the 6th of March, and at the Philippines on the
16th of March. This bold navigator, "second only to Columbus in the history
of nautical exploration," was killed on the 27th of April, in a battle with the
natives of one of these islands; the remainder of the force, consisting of 115
men under Caraballo, proceeded on their way, touching at Borneo and other
islands, and anchoring on the 8th of November at the Moluccas, their destination.
From this point one of the vessels, the <i>Vitoria</i>, in command of
Sebastian del Cano, sailed round the Cape of Good Hope, and reached San
Lúcar September 6, 1522, with only eighteen survivors of the 265 who had
sailed with Magellan. Thus was accomplished the first circumnavigation
of the globe.

<div class="sidenote">THE NAMING OF THE PACIFIC OCEAN.</div>

<p class="p2 blockquot">
As to the circumstances attending the naming of the Pacific Ocean, a few
words may not be out of place. Magellan was accompanied by one Antonio
Pigafetta, of Vicenza, afterward Caviliere di Rhodi, who wrote in bad Italian
a narrative of the voyage, which was rewritten and translated into French,
<i>Primer voyage autour du Monde, par le Chevallier Pigafetta, sur l'Escadre de
Magellan pendant les années 1519, 20, 21, et 22</i>, by Charles Amoretti. "Le
mercredi, 28 novembre," says Pigafetta, liv. ii. p. 50, "nous débouquâmes
du détroit pour entrer dans la grande mer, à laquelle nous donnâmes ensuite
le nom de mer Pacifique; dans laquelle nous naviguâmes pendant le cours de trois mois et vingt jours,
sans goûter d'aucune nourriture fraiche." And
again, p. 52, "Pendant cet espace de trois mois et vingt jours nous parcourûmes
à peu près quatre mille lieues dans cette mer que nous appelâmes Pacifique,
parce que durant tout le temps de notre traversée nous n'essuyâmes pas
le moindre tempête;" or, as Ramusio, <i>Viaggio atorno il mondo fatto et descritto
per M. Antonio Pigafetta</i>, in <i>Viaggi</i>, tom. iii. fol. 393, puts it, "Et in questi
tre mesi, &amp; venti giorni fecero quattro mila leghe in vn golfo per questo mar
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_136' href='#Page_136'>136</a></span>
Pacifico, il qual ben si puó chiamar pacifico, perche in tutto questo tempo senza
veder mai terra alcuna, non hebbero né fortuna di vento, né di altra tempesta."
Peter Martyr, dec. v. cap. vii., speaks of it only as "the huge Ocean"
first found by Vasco Nuñez, and then called the South Sea. Galvano, <i>Discov.</i>,
p. 142, alludes to it as a "mightie sea called Pacificum." Oviedo, <i>Hist.
Gen.</i>, tom. ii. p. 22, merely remarks: "Es aquel estrecho en algunas partes mas
ó menos de media legua, y çircundado de montañas altissimas cargadas de
nieve, y corre en otra mar que le puso nombre el capitan Fernando de Magallanes,
el <i>Mar Pacífico</i>; y es muy profundo, y en algunas partes de veynte é
çinco hasta en treynta braças." Gomara, <i>Hist. Ind.</i>, fol. 120, says, "No cabia
de gozo por auer hallado aq̃l passo para el otro mar del Sur, por do pẽsava
llegar presto alas yslas del Maluco," without any mention of the word Pacific.
The <i>Sammlung aller Reisebeschreibungen</i>, tom. xi. p. 346, gives it essentially
the same as Pigafetta: "In einer Zeit von drey Monaten und zwanzig
Tagen, legete er viertausend Meilen in einer See zurück, welche er das friedfertige
oder stille Meer nannte; weil er keinen Sturm auf demselben ausstund,
und kein anderes Land sah, als diese beyden Inseln." Kohl, <i>Die beiden ältesten
Karten von Am.</i>, p. 161, is unable to find the name on the old maps: "Der
Name 'Oceano Pacifico,' der auch schon auf den Reisen des Magellan und
Loaysa in Schwung kam, steht nirgends auf unseren Karten." Herrera, dec.
ii. lib. ix. cap. xv., describes the exit from the strait in the language following:
"a veynte y siete de Nouiẽbre, salio al espacioso mar del Sur, dando
infinitas gracias a Dios." Navarrete, <i>Viages al Maluco; Primero el de Hernando
de Magallanes</i>, in tom. iv. pp. 49-50, of his collection says: "Salió pues
Magallanes del <i>estrecho que nombraron de Todos los Santos</i> el dia 27 de Noviembre
de 1520 con las tres naos Trinidad, Victoria, y Concepcion, y se halló
en una mar oscura y gruesa que era indicio de gran golfo; pero despues le
nombraron <i>Mar Pacífico</i>, porque en todo el tiempo que navegaron por él, no
tuvieron tempestad alguna." Happening thus, that in this first circumnavigation
of the globe, as the strangers entered at its southern end the South
Sea of Vasco Nuñez, the waters greeted them kindly, in return they gave them
a peaceful title; other voyagers entering this same sea at other times gave to
it a far different character. For further reference see <i>Voyage de Fernando de
Magelhaens</i>, in <i>Berenger</i>, <i>Col. Voy.</i>, tom. i. pp. 1-26;

This is the first drawing to represent all the regions of the New World as
distinct, although not distant, from the Asiatic coast, which is laid down
mostly as in Behaim's globe, with some imaginary additions round the north
pole. This separation was undoubtedly a mere conjecture of the compiler,
for the voyage of Magellan, which might have suggested such an idea, was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_138' href='#Page_138'>138</a></span>
not yet known or even consummated, and the map shows no knowledge of
the later voyages even to the eastern coast. All the northern discoveries are
given as an island, 'Terra Corterealis.' The central and southern parts—except
their separation from Asia—are accurately copied from the map of Ptolemy,
1513 (see <a href="#Page_130">page 130</a>), although a strait leads through the Isthmus into the South
Sea. 'Terra de Cuba' is the name applied to the northern part of what may
be regarded as the nucleus which afterward grew into North America, while
the southern part is called Paria. Several names of localities on the coast,
as 'C. Dellicontis' and 'C. Bonaventura,' are retained from the map of 1513,
although Kohl erroneously calls all the names new and original. To the
southern continent various names are applied, as America, Brazil, Paria
(repeated), Land of Cannibals and of Parrots. On the original is an antarctic
region round the south pole, called 'Brasiliæ Regio,' and separated from America
in lat. 42° south by a strait, although the discovery of such a strait could
not at the time have been known. <i>Humboldt</i>, <i>Exam. Crit.</i>, tom. ii. p. 28.

Ponce de Leon in 1513, and finally touched the coast in about 32° or 33°—Port

<p class="blockquot">
The conquest of Mexico once accomplished, Hernan Cortés very soon
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_139' href='#Page_139'>139</a></span>
turned his attention to the South Sea coasts. Hearing from natives that the
Pacific extended as far north as the land he had conquered, he sent small
parties to explore and take possession, which they did at two points, Tehuantepec
and Zacatula, before the end of 1521. Cortés was fully acquainted
with the cosmographic theories of the time, and was enthusiastic in their
application to the discovery of islands and main, rich in spices and precious
metals. It was now established in a general way, as shown by the best maps,
that the newly discovered lands were not the main Asiatic continent of Marco
Polo, but a great south-eastern projection of that continent, probably separated
from it by a strait. Cortés' idea was to sail down the coast as he
termed it, northward at first, until he should either reach the rich Indian lands,
or on the way find the strait which should afford a short cut from Spain to
those lands. His efforts will be briefly noticed here in chronologic order, but
fully presented in another part of my work. The best and almost only authority

In 1524 was made the first official French expedition to the New World.
A fleet of four vessels was made ready under Giovanni Verrazano at Dieppe,
but three of his ships were separated from him in some inexplicable manner
before leaving European waters; and in the remaining one, the <i>Dauphine</i>,
with fifty men, he sailed on the 17th of January, 1524, from an island near
Madeira. After a voyage of forty-nine days, during which time he sailed
900 leagues, Verrazano struck the United States coast in about latitude 34°,
perhaps at Cape Fear. Thence he sailed first southward fifty leagues, then
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_141' href='#Page_141'>141</a></span>
turning about he followed the coast northward, frequently touching, to
Newfoundland, whence he returned to Dieppe in July, 1524. Verrazano
in his journal mentions only one date, and names but one locality; consequently
there is much difference of opinion concerning his landings.

The southern limit of the voyage, so far as it can be known, was in the
vicinity of Cape Romain, South Carolina, though some authors, apparently
without sufficient authority—the voyager says he saw palms—have placed
the limit in Florida. It is probable that a large part of the United States
coast was for the first time explored during this voyage, which also completed
the discovery of the whole eastern shore-line of America, except probably a
short but indefinite distance in South Carolina and Georgia, between the
limits reached by Ponce de Leon in 1513 and by Verrazano; one intermediate
point having also been visited by Aillon in 1520. <i>Relatione di Giouanni da Verrazzano

A meeting of the leading pilots and cosmographers of Spain and Portugal,

disputed questions between the two governments. Failing in its primary
purpose, the council nevertheless contributed largely to a better knowledge

may be supposed to have had, and to have delineated on their official
charts, tolerably accurate ideas of the general form of America and of its

[1525.] The man who accompanied Magellan in 1519, but left him after
entering the strait and returned with one vessel to Spain, was named Estévan
Gomez. In 1525 this captain was sent by Spain to search for a corresponding
strait in the north. Although an official expedition, and the only one ever
sent by Spain to northern parts, no journal has been preserved, and only
slight particulars derived from the old chroniclers are known. Gomez expected
to find a strait somewhere between Florida and Newfoundland, probably
not knowing the result of Verrazano's voyage of the preceding year.
Cabot was at the time piloto mayor in Spain, and if Verrazano had, as is
claimed for him by some, reached the southern United States coasts, it is not
likely that Gomez would have looked there so confidently for his strait. This
voyage lasted about ten months, and in it Gomez is supposed to have explored
the coast from Newfoundland to a point below New York—possibly to
Georgia or Florida. <i>Peter Martyr</i>, dec. vi. cap. x.;

In 1526 a commissioner was appointed to correct the Spanish charts. Fernando

the strait of Magellan to Greenland, and the western coast from Panamá to
the vicinity of Soconusco, and indicates that the information in possession of
the Spanish government was remarkably accurate and complete. Yucatan is
represented as an island, and the discoveries on the Pacific side of South
America are not laid down; otherwise this map varies but little except in

Greenland is called Labrador and is joined to the continent, as the separating
strait had not at the time been explored. It will be noticed that
Greenland is far less accurately laid down on this and other late maps than
on some earlier ones which are supposed to have derived some of their details
from northern sources. Labrador, Newfoundland, and Nova Scotia have the
general name of Bacallaos. Many of the numerous islands along the coast
are named in the original. Corresponding perhaps to the New England and
middle United States we have the 'Tiera de Estevã Gomez,' stated by an inscription
to have been discovered by the Spaniards in 1525. From this land
to Florida extends the 'Tiera de Ayllon,' between which and 'Nveva España'
comes the 'Tiera de Garay,' thus dividing nearly all of the northern continent
among the Spaniards. The West India Islands have here their true number,
position, and names. Yucatan is given in its true proportions but is separated
by a strait from the main-land. The South Sea coast is represented
only to the limit of the voyage of Gil Gonzalez Dávila on the north, and
extends southward to the port of Chinchax in about latitude 10° south, including,
according to an inscription, the countries which had been reached
by Pizarro in 1527. The form of South America is correctly laid down and
the name 'Mvndvs Novvs' is applied to the whole, which is divided into the
provinces of 'Castilla del Oro,' 'Perv,' 'Tiera del Brasil,' 'Tiera de Patagones,'
and 'Tiera de Fernã de Magallaes,' or land of Magellan. South of the strait
is the 'Tiera de los Fuegos,' whose true form and extent were not known
until Schouten and Le Maire doubled Cape Horn in 1616.

Thus far I have copied or mentioned all maps which could throw any light
on the progress of geographical knowledge, and have endeavored to give a
statement of all the voyages by which this progress was made. Thus far we
have seen the coasts of both North and South America, except in the south-west
and the far north-west, more or less carefully explored by European
voyagers; we have seen the New World recognized as distinct for the most
part from Asia, a tolerably correct idea of its form and extent given by government
pilots, and the name America applied, except on official maps, to
the southern continent. Henceforth voyages to the parts already discovered
become of common occurrence, and numerous maps, both in manuscript and
print, are made, no one of which I shall attempt to follow. In the expeditions
of the next and concluding ten years of this Summary I shall notice
chiefly those by which a knowledge was acquired of the countries lying
toward California and the great Northwest, presenting several maps to illustrate

[1532.] At last, in the middle of 1532, Cortés was able to despatch from Acapulco
two vessels, under Hurtado de Mendoza and Mazuela, to make the first
voyage up the coast beyond Colima. Mendoza touched at Santiago and at the
port of Jalisco, near the later San Blas, discovering the islands of Magdalena,
or Tres Marías. Then they took refuge from a storm in a port located only
by conjecture, probably on the Sonora coast, where after a time the vessels
parted. Mendoza went on up the coast. Having landed and ascended the
Rio Tamotchala—now the Fuerte—he was killed, with most of his men, by
the Indians. The rest were massacred a little later, when the vessel grounded
and broke up at the mouth of the Rio Petatlan, or Sinaloa. Meanwhile,
Mazuela with the other vessel returning down the coast was driven ashore
in Banderas Bay, where all his men but two or three were killed by the
natives. Authorities, being voluminous, complicated, and of necessity fully
presented elsewhere, are omitted here.

All of the New World, so far as explored, is represented with tolerable
accuracy, but the unexplored South Sea coast is made to extend westward
from the region of Acapulco, and to join the southern coast of Asia, which is
laid down from the ancient chronicles. Instead of being, as Stevens terms it,
a "culmination of absurdities," I regard this map as more consistent with
the knowledge of the time than any other printed during the first half of the
sixteenth century. North America when found was regarded as Asia; South
America was at first supposed to be a large island, and later an immense
south-eastern extension of Asia; subsequent explorations, chiefly that of
Magellan, showed the existence of a vast ocean between southern America
and southern Asia; official maps left unexplored regions blank, expressing no
theory as to the northern extension of the Pacific Ocean; other maps, as we
have seen, without any authority whatever, make that ocean extend north
and completely separate Asia from the New World. The present map, however,
clings to the original idea and makes North America an eastern extension
of Asia, giving the name America to the southern continent.

Niza's report prompted Cortés to renewed efforts in his Californian enterprise,
and in July, 1539, Francisco de Ulloa was sent from Acapulco with
three vessels to prosecute the discoveries by water. Ulloa spent some time
in the port of Santiago for repairs, lost one vessel in a gale near the entrance
to the gulf, visited Santa Cruz, and then followed the main coast to the
mouth of the Colorado, and returned along the coast of the Peninsula to
Santa Cruz, where he arrived on the 18th of October. From this place he
doubled the southern point of California, and sailed up the western coast to
Cedros Island, and somewhat beyond. During the whole voyage he touched
and named many places, whose names have seldom been retained, but some
of which may be with tolerable certainty identified. In April the vessels
separated, one returning by a quick passage to Colima. Ulloa himself with
the other vessel attempted to continue his explorations northward, with what

[1540.] Also in consequence of Marcos de Niza's reports, Francisco Vazquez
de Coronado, who had succeeded Nuño de Guzman and Torre as governor of New
Galicia, set out from Culiacan in April, 1540, penetrated to the Pueblo towns,
or the Seven Cities of Cibola, and thence to the valley of the Rio Grande and
far toward the north-east to Quivira, whose location, fixed by him in latitude
40°, has been a much disputed question. While in Sonora, he sent forth
Melchor Diaz, who explored the head of the gulf, and the mouths of the rivers,
Gila and Colorado, where he found letters left by Alarcon. See <i>infra</i>. From
Cibola, Coronado sent Garcia Lopez de Cárdenas west, who passed through
the Moqui towns and followed the Colorado for some distance. Coronado
returned in 1542. <i>Relatione che mando Francesco Vazquez di Coronado</i>, in

To coöperate with Coronado's land expedition, Hernando de Alarcon was
despatched from Acapulco in May, 1540. Alarcon followed the coast to the
head of the gulf, and ascended the Buena Guia (Colorado) some eighty-five
leagues in boats, but hearing nothing from Coronado, he returned after burying
letters, which, as we have seen, were found by Melchor Diaz. Beside the

A similar chart is mentioned by Señor Navarrete as existing in the hydrographic
archives in Madrid. The second, from the <i>Munich Atlas</i>, no. vi., is
of uncertain date. Peschel places it between 1532 and 1540; and it was
certainly made about that time, as Yucatan is represented as an island,
and California as a peninsula, although later it came again to be considered
an island, as at its first discovery.

This, then, was Discovery. And in the progress of discovery we may trace
the progress of mind. We can but wonder now, when we see our little earth
belted with steam and lightning, how reluctantly the infant intellect left its
cradle to examine its surroundings. Wrapped in its Mediterranean swaddlings,
it crept forth timidly, tremblingly, slowly gaining courage with
experience, until, throwing off impediments, it trod the earth in the fearless
pride of manhood. Like all science, philosophy, and religion, cosmography
was at first a superstition. Walled within narrow limits, as we have seen,
by imaginary frost and fire, shaken from fear of heaven above and hell beneath,
there is little wonder that the ancients dared not venture far from
home; nor that, when men began to explore parts unknown, there should
appear that romance of geography so fascinating to the Greek mind, that halo
thrown by the dimness of time and distance over strange seas and lands.
From this time to that of the adaptation of the magnet to purposes of navigation,
about a score of centuries, there was little progress in discovery.

Is it not strange how the secrets of nature, one after another, reveal themselves
according to man's necessities? Who would have looked for the deliverance
of pent-up humanity from certain mysterious qualities in magnetic
iron ore, which floated toward the north that side of a cork on which it was
placed? When Vasco da Gama and Columbus almost simultaneously opened
to Europe oceanic highways through which were destined to flow the treasures
of the eastern and the western Indies, then it was that a new quality was
discovered in the loadstone; for in addition to its power to take up iron, it
was found to possess the rare virtue of drawing gold and silver from distant
parts into the coffers of European princes; then it was that paths were marked
out across the Sea of Darkness, and ships passed to and fro bearing the
destroyers of nations, and laden with their spoils.

In the developments of progress the agent,
however subordinate to the event, cannot fail to
command our intelligent curiosity. The fact is less
one with us than the factor. The instrument is
nearer us in pulsating humanity than the event,
which is the result of inexorable causations wholly
beyond our knowledge. That America could not
have remained much longer hidden from the civilized
world does not lessen the vivid interest which attaches
to the man Columbus, as he plods along the
dusty highway toward Huelva, leading by the hand
his boy, and bearing upon his shoulders the more
immediate destinies of nations.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_156' href='#Page_156'>156</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Nor are we indifferent to the agencies that evolved
the agent. Every signal success springs from a fortuitous
conjunction of talent and opportunity; from
a coalition of taste or training with the approaching
fancy or dominant idea of the times. While assisting
his father wool-combing, the youthful Genoese
was toughening his sinews and acquiring habits of
industry; while studying geometry and Latin at
Pavia, while serving as sailor in the Mediterranean,
or afterward cruising the high seas, he was knitting
more firmly the tissues of his mind, and strengthening
his courage for the life-conflict which was to
follow. Without such discipline, in vain from the
north and south and west might Progress come
whispering him secrets; for inspiration without action
is but impalpable breath, leaving no impression, and
genius unseasoned by application decomposes to corruption
all the more rank by reason of its richness.
</p>

<p>
His marriage with the daughter of Bartolommeo
Perestrello, a distinguished navigator under Prince
Henry; his map-making as means of support; his
residence on the isle of Porto Santo, and his interest
while there in maritime discovery; his conversations
and correspondence with navigators and cosmographers
in various quarters; his zealous study of the
writings of Marco Polo, Benjamin of Tudela, and
Carpini, and his eager absorption of the fantastic
tale of Antonio Leone, of Madeira; his ponderings
on ocean mysteries, and his struggles with poverty;
his audience of John of Portugal, and the treachery
of that monarch in attempting to anticipate his plans
by secretly sending out a vessel, and the deserved
defeat which followed; his sending his brother Bartolomé
with proposals to England; his stealing from
Lisbon with his son Diego, lest he should be arrested
for debt; his supposed application to Genoa; his
interviews with the dukes of Medina Sidonia and
Medina Celi, and the letter of the latter to Queen
Isabella of Castile; his visit to the court at Córdova,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_157' href='#Page_157'>157</a></span>
and the dark days attending it; the conference of
learned men at Salamanca, and their unfavorable
verdict; the weary waitings on the preoccupied sovereigns
at Málaga and Seville; the succor given at
La Rábida, and the worthy prior's intercession with
the queen; the humble dignity of the mariner at
Granada amidst scenes of oriental splendor and general
rejoicings, which only intensified his discontent;
the lofty constancy in his demands when once a royal
hearing was obtained; the fresh disappointment after
such long delay, and the proud bitterness of spirit
with which he turned his back on Spain to seek in
France a patron for his schemes; the final appeal of
Santángel, who afterward assisted in obtaining the
money, and the conversion of Isabella, who now
offered, if necessary, to pledge her jewels to meet the
charges of the voyage; the despatching of a royal
courier after the determined fugitive, who returned
in joy to receive the tardy aid—these incidents in
the career of Columbus are a household story.
</p>

<p>
And therein, thus far, we see displayed great
persistency of purpose by one possessed of a conception
so stupendous as to overwhelm well-nigh the
strongest; by one not over-careful in money-matters,
or morality; proud and sensitive whenever the pet
project is touched, but affable enough otherwise,
and not above begging upon necessity. It was a
long time to wait, eighteen years, when every day
was one of alternate hope and despair; and they were
not altogether worthless, those noiseless voices from
another world, which kept alive in him the inspiration
that oft-times now appeared as the broken
tracery of a half-remembered dream.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">TERMS OF AGREEMENT.</div>

<p>
An agreement was made by the sovereigns and
the mariner, that to Columbus, his heirs and successors
forever, should be secured the office of admiral,
and the titles of viceroy and governor-general of all
the lands and seas he should discover, with power
to nominate candidates from whom the sovereigns
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_158' href='#Page_158'>158</a></span>
might choose rulers for the realms discovered; that
one tenth of the net returns of gold, pearls, or other
commodities brought therefrom should be his; that
in disputes arising from the new traffic he, or his
lieutenant, should be sole arbitrator within his
domain, the high admiral of Castile being judge
within his district; and that by contributing one
eighth of the cost of any enterprise to the regions
found by him he should receive one eighth the
profits. To these dignities and prerogatives was
added the right of the discoverer, and of his heirs,
to prefix to their names the title 'Don,' which should
elevate them into respectability beside the grandees
of Spain. This agreement was signed by Ferdinand
as well as by Isabella, although the crown of Castile
alone assumed the risk, and alone was to receive the
benefit.
</p>

<p class="p2">
It was not a common spectacle in those days along
the southern seaboard of Spain, that of science urging
religion into its service. Nevertheless, by royal order,
reiterated by Peñalosa in person with pronounced
effect, the devil-fearers of Palos were forced to provide
ships and seamen for what they regarded as
anything but an orthodox adventure. This they did
with the greatest reluctance.
</p>

<p>
Even under pressure of that civil and ecclesiastical
system so completely interwoven in Spain that to
disobey one was rebellion against both, even in the
face of king and priest, these mechanical sea-farers,
who halted not before tangible danger in any form,
shrank from the awful uncertainty of a plunge into
the mysteries of the dim, lowering, unintelligible
west. Then came bravely forward the brothers Pinzon,
and not only assisted in providing two ships,
so that Queen Isabella, after all, might wear her
jewels while her deputy was scouring the high seas
for new dominions, but furnished Columbus with
money to equip another vessel and to pay his eighth
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_159' href='#Page_159'>159</a></span>
of the charge which should secure him one eighth of
the profits—a service never sufficiently remembered
or rewarded by either Columbus, his masters, or
successors.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">FIRST VOYAGE.</div>

<p>
The expedition comprised one hundred and twenty
men, in three small vessels, the <i>Santa María</i>,
decked, and carrying the flag of the admiral, and
the <i>Pinta</i> and <i>Niña</i>, open caravels, commanded by
Martin Alonso Pinzon and Vicente Yañez Pinzon
respectively. Among others were the inspector-general
of the armament, Rodrigo Sanchez; the
chief alguacil, Diego de Arana; the royal notary,
Rodrigo de Escobar; and four pilots, Francisco
Martin Pinzon, Sancho Ruiz, Pedro Alonso Niño,
and Bartolomé Roldan. The commander-in-chief
with his tall, enduring form bowed by an idea; his
long, thin face, with its large, round eyes, high
forehead, straight, pointed nose; features, in which
tenacity and gloom struggled for the predominance,
surrounded by thin locks and gray beard—was
scarcely a personage either to inspire confidence or
win affection. The squadron sailed from the port
of Palos August 3, 1492.
</p>

<p>
But for the fact that it was the first, the voyage
was quite commonplace; the most serious occurrences
being the breaking of a rudder, which obliged
the expedition to put in at the Canaries for repairs,
and the variation of the needle, which caused a little
fright among the pilots. The sea was tranquil,
toward the last extremely so, and the wind generally
favorable; yet no small trepidation attended this
gradual loosening of hold upon the substantial world,
and the drifting daily farther and farther into the
fathomless unknown. Hence it was with the wildest
joy that early in the morning of the 12th of October
the cry of Land! was heard, and that soon afterward
the venturesome navigators felt beneath their feet
the indubitable isle to which they gave the name
San Salvador, taking possession for Castile.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_160' href='#Page_160'>160</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Now the sovereigns had promised that he who first
saw land should be recompensed by a pension of ten
thousand maravedís, equivalent to thirty-six dollars.
It was at two o'clock in the morning that Rodrigo
de Triana, a mariner on board the <i>Pinta</i>, gave the
signal, the first that proved true after several had
been mistakenly made; whereupon he claimed the
reward. But previously, during the night, Columbus
had fancied he descried a fitful light that should be
on some shore. On the strength of this surmise he
secured to himself the insignificant sum, which, to
say nothing of its justness, was not a very magnanimous
proceeding in so great a discoverer. We are
told of Triana, that, burning under a sense of wrong,
after returning to Spain, he passed into Africa and
turned Mahometan. However this may have been,
dawn had shown them the island, which seemed
itself but dawn, to be dispelled by the full sun's rays
when the night's dream had passed. Over the trackless
waste of sea, suspended between earth and sky,
the good ships had felt their way, until now, like
goddesses, they sat at anchor on the other side of
Ocean.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Though this land was unlike the Zipangu of his
dreams, Columbus was not disposed to complain; but
rather, midst tears and praises, to kiss the earth, be
it of whatsoever quality, and smile benignantly upon
the naked natives that crept timidly forward, wondering
whether the ships were monsters of the deep,
or bright beings dropped from heaven.
</p>

<p>
Of a truth, it was a wonderful place, this India of
Marco Polo that the Genoese now sought. Intersected
by rivers and canals, spanned by bridges under
which the largest ships might sail, were fertile provinces
fragrant with fruit and spices. Mangi alone
boasted twelve thousand cities with gorgeous palaces,
whose pillars and roofs were emblazoned in gold, and
so situated as to be compassed within a few days'
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_161' href='#Page_161'>161</a></span>
travel. The cities and fortresses of Cathay were
counted by tens of thousands, and their busy population
by millions. On every side were gardens
and luxurious groves; pleasure-boats and banqueting-barges
floated on the lakes, and myriads of white
sails swept over the bays. The mountains were
veined with silver, the river-beds paved with gold,
and pearls were as common as pebbles. Sheep were
as large as oxen, and oxen were as large as elephants.
Birds of brilliant plumage filled the enchanting air,
and strange beasts of beauty and utility roamed the
forests. The inhabitants were arrayed in silks and
furs, and fed on luscious viands; there were living
springs that cured all diseases. The army of the
great Khan, the happy ruler of all these glories,
was in number as the grains of the sand which the
sea surrounds; and as for vessels of war, and horses,
and elephants, there were a thousand times ten thousand.
What a contrast to such a creation was this
low-lying strip of jungle-covered sand, peopled by
copper-hued creatures dwelling in huts, and sustaining
life by the natural products of the unkempt
earth! This, however, was but an outlying island
of Cathay; the main-land of Asia could not be far
distant; in any event, here was India, and these
people were Indians.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE TWO INDIAS COMPARED.</div>

<p>
There was little enough, now appearing, in the
India thus far found to enrich Spain. In their noses
the natives displayed gold, always a royal monopoly
when discovered; and they brought cotton for barter,
on which the admiral immediately laid the same
restriction. Being informed, by signs, that the metal
came from the south, after examining the shore
thereabout in boats, the Spaniards set sail on the
14th, took possession of Santa María de la Concepcion
on the 15th, of Fernandina, now Exuma, the
day following, and afterward of Isabela, now Isla
Larga, or Long Island; also of a group to which
they gave the name Islas de Arena. Soils and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_162' href='#Page_162'>162</a></span>
other substances, atmospheres and sunshines, were all
familiar; plants and animals, though differing in degree
and kind, were similar to those they had always
been accustomed to see. One creation was everywhere
apparent; one nature; one rule. It was wonderful,
stupendous! And if these human kind have
souls, what a mighty work is here to fit them for
eternity!
</p>

<p>
Crossing the Bahama Bank, they came on the
28th to Cuba, which Columbus called Juana, and
which, with its dense uprolling green spangled with
parrots, gay woodpeckers, and humming-birds, scarlet
flamingoes and glittering insects; its trees of royal
palm, cocoanut, cedar, mahogany, and shrubs of
spicy fragrance; its unknown fruits and foods; its
transparent waters whose finny denizens flashed back
the sunlight from their variegated scales, all under
the brightest of skies, all breathed upon by softest
airs, and lapped in serenest seas, was more like his
own Zipangu, if, indeed, it was not Mangi itself.
</p>

<p>
Coasting eastward, the <i>Pinta</i> sailed away and left
the other vessels, and it was with deep chagrin that
Columbus saw no attention paid his signals to return.
Pinzon had heard of gold-fields in advance of him,
and he was going to reap them. The wreck of the
<i>Santa María</i> a month afterward, leaving the admiral
only the little <i>Niña</i>, made his situation all the more
critical, and made him feel more keenly than ever
the desertion. Nor was this the first indication of
mutiny and disruption among his people during the
voyage. If the truth must be told, the character
of the man, though inured to the cruel hardihood of
the age, seems here to be undergoing change; else
it was not originally as either he or his friends have
estimated. The new and varied experiences amidst
the new and varied phenomena attending the idea
and its consummation make it a matter of no wonder
that his head began to be a little turned. He had
pondered painfully on what Aristotle taught regarding
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_163' href='#Page_163'>163</a></span>
the sphericity of the earth, on what Seneca said
about sailing to the Indies westwardly, and on the
terrestrial paradise placed by Dante at the antipodes
of the holy city; and now he was here among those
happy regions of which so long ago philosophers had
spoken and poets sung. Under the inspiration of
rare intelligence, and by wonderful courage and force
of will, this Genoese sailor had brought to his own
terms the world's proudest sovereigns. Success, in
his mind the most perfect, the most complete, was by
this time proved beyond peradventure. At the outset
he had suspected himself the special agent of the
supernatural; now he was sure of it. It was meet,
therefore, that all men should fear and obey him.
Impelled to activity, he was impelled, if necessary,
to severity. During the passage he had deemed
it expedient several times to mislead the sailors,
who were consequently backward about reposing in
him the respect and confidence due a commander.
Suspicious of the Spanish sovereigns from the first,
his fears constantly increased as the magnitude of
his discovery slowly unfolded before him, that he
should eventually be robbed of it. He was jealous
lest any of those who had shared with him the perils
of the adventure should secure to themselves some
part of the honor or profit attending it. He had
quarrelled with the Pinzons, who, having staked
their money and lives on what was generally regarded
a mad risk, thought some consideration from the
commander their due. The admiral's temper was
tamed somewhat by the very boldness of Pinzon's
act; for when the <i>Pinta</i> returned from her cruisings,
little was then said about it; but if ever the
opportunity should come, her commander must pay
dearly for his disobedience.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">SAILING AMONG THE ISLANDS.</div>

<p>
Cuba failed to display any opulent oriental city,
but furnished tobacco and maize, gifts from savagism
to civilization as comforting, perhaps, as any
received in return. The mariners next discovered
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_164' href='#Page_164'>164</a></span>
and coasted Hayti, or Española, thus occupying the
greater part of December. On the northern side
of the island, out of the wrecked <i>Santa María</i>
and her belongings, Columbus built and equipped a
fortress, which he called La Navidad; and leaving
there thirty-nine men under command of Diego de
Arana, with Pedro Gutierrez and Rodrigo de Escobedo,
lieutenants, on the 4th of January, 1493, he
embarked for Spain. Those left behind were expected
by the ardent-minded admiral, during his
absence, to obtain, in trade, a ton of gold, beside
discovering mines and spices.
</p>

<p>
Violent storms attended the homeward voyage;
but on the 15th of March the expedition reached
Palos in safety, after touching at the Azores and
the coast of Portugal. Then followed rejoicings.
Over Spain, over Europe, the tidings flew: A New
World to the westward! Bells rang and choirs
pealed hosannas. A New World for Spain; now
were their Catholic Majesties well paid for their
losses and trials in connection with Mahometans and
Jews!
</p>

<p>
With six natives, and divers birds and plants and
other specimens from the Islands, Columbus set out
for Barcelona, then the residence of the Spanish sovereigns.
Throughout the journey, the highway and
houses were thronged with spectators eager for a
glimpse of the strange spectacle. Arrived at court,
the great mariner was most graciously received,
being permitted even to be seated in the presence of
royalty. He told his tale. It is said that all present
wept. Columbus was as much excited as any. In
a delirium of joy he vowed within seven years to
appoint an army of four thousand horse and fifty
thousand foot for the rescue of Jerusalem, and to pay
the cost out of his own pocket; but, unfortunately, he
never found himself in funds sufficient to fulfil his
pious promise. The original compact between the
sovereigns and the discoverer was confirmed, and to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_165' href='#Page_165'>165</a></span>
the latter was granted a family coat of arms. While
Columbus was fêted by the nobles, and all the world
resounded with his praises, Martin Alonso Pinzon
lay a-dying; the reward for his invaluable services,
exceeding a hundred-fold all that Isabella and Ferdinand
together had done, being loss of property, loss
of health, the insults of the admiral, the scorn of the
queen, all now happily crowned by speedy death.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">A HAPPY PEOPLE.</div>

<p class="p2">
Never had nature made, within historic times, a
paradise more perfect than this Cuba and this Hayti
that the Genoese had found. Never was a sylvan
race more gentle, more hospitable than that which
peopled this primeval garden. Naked, because they
needed not clothing; dwelling under palm-leaves,
such being sufficient protection; their sustenance the
spontaneous gifts of the ever generous land and sea;
undisturbed by artificial curbings and corrections, and
tormented by no ambitions, their life was a summer
day, as blissful as mortals can know. It was as
Eden; without work they might enjoy all that earth
could give. Disease and pain they scarcely knew;
only death was terrible. In their social intercourse
they were sympathizing, loving, and decorous, practising
the sublimest religious precepts without knowing
it, and obeying Christ more perfectly than many
who profess to serve him. With strangers the men
were frank, cordial, honest; the women artless and
compliant. Knowing no guile, they suspected none.
Possessing all things, they gave freely of that which
cost them nothing. Having no laws, they broke
none; circumscribed by no conventional moralities,
they were not immoral. If charity be the highest
virtue, and purity and peace the greatest good, then
were these savages far better and happier beings
than any civilization could boast. That they possessed
any rights, any natural or inherent privileges
in regard to their lands or their lives; that these
innocent and inoffensive people were not fit subjects
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_166' href='#Page_166'>166</a></span>
for coercion, treachery, robbery, enslavement, and
slaughter, was a matter which seems never to have
been questioned at that time by either discoverer,
adventurer, or ruler. However invalid in any of the
Spanish courts might have been the argument of a
house-breaker, that in the room he entered he discovered
a purse of gold, and took it, Spaniards never
thought of applying such logic to themselves in regard
to the possessions of the natives in the new lands
their Genoese had found.
</p>

<p>
What Spain required now was a title such as the
neighboring nations of Europe should recognize as
valid. So far as the doctrine was concerned, of appropriating
to themselves the possessions of others, they
were all equally sound in it. Europe with her steel
and saltpetre and magnetic needle was stronger than
naked barbarians, whose possessions were thereupon
seized as fast as found. The right to such robbery
has been held sacred since the earliest records of the
human race; and it was by this time legalized by the
civilized nations. Savagism had no rights which
civilization was bound to respect. The world belonged
not to Christian or Mahometan, but to whatever
idea, principle, or power could take it. In none
of their pretended principles, in none of their codes of
honor or ethics, was there any other ultimate appeal
than brute force; their deity they made to fit the
occasion, whatever that might be. This they did not
know, however. They thought themselves patterns
of justice and fair morality; and all that troubled
them was in what attitude they would stand toward
each other with regard to their several discoveries
and conquests. But while such was the recognized
condition of affairs at the beginning of the sixteenth
century among the reckless adventurers of Spain,
such were not the teachings of the Church, nor the
views of the intelligent and right thinking men of
the time. True, the army of fortune-seekers who
first rushed to the new world in search of gold came
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_167' href='#Page_167'>167</a></span>
for lust and plunder, but with them, and inspired with
very different motives, came the missionaries of the
cross, pointing the savages to civilization and a purer
religion than their own. But civilization and religion,
it must be confessed, had little to recommend them
in the examples of unprincipled men who were ever
present to give the lie to the teachings of the priests.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE WORLD PARTITIONED BY THE POPE.</div>

<p>
Thus it was that the Spanish sovereigns, being
Christian, applied for a confirmation of title to Alexander
VI., then sovereign pontiff of Christendom, at
the same time insinuating, in a somewhat worldly
fashion, that learned men regarded the rights of their
Catholic Majesties secure enough even without such
confirmation. No valid objections before the holy
tribunal could be raised against Christian princes
powerful enough to sustain their pretensions to ownership
while propagating the true faith in heathen
lands; but Pope Eugene IV. and his successors had
already granted Portugal all lands discovered by
Portuguese from Cape Bojador to the Indies. In
order, therefore, to avoid conflict, the bull issued the
2d of May, 1493, ceding Spain the same rights
respecting discoveries already granted Portugal, was
on the day following defined to this effect:—An imaginary
line of demarcation should be drawn from
pole to pole, one hundred leagues west of the Azores
and Cape Verde Islands; all lands discovered east of
that line should be Portugal's, while west of that
line all should belong to Spain. Thus by a very
mortal breath and the flourish of a pen, the unknown
world, with all its multitudes of interests and inhabitants,
was divided between these two sovereignties,
occupying the peninsula of south-western Europe;
though in their wisdom they forgot that if the world
was round, Portugal in going east and Spain in going
west must somewhere meet, and might yet quarrel
on the other side. Subsequently, that is to say on
the 7th of June, 1494, by treaty between Spain and
Portugal the papal line of partition was removed,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_168' href='#Page_168'>168</a></span>
making it three hundred and seventy leagues west
of the Cape Verde Islands, Portugal having complained
of want of sea-room for southern enterprise.
This removal ultimately gave the Portuguese Brazil.
And ecclesiastics claim that care was ever exercised
by the Spanish crown to comply with the obligations
thus laid upon it by this holy sanction.
</p>

<p>
Appointed to take charge of the affairs of the
New World was Juan Rodriguez de Fonseca, arch-deacon
of Seville, and afterward patriarch of the
Indies. Although high in ecclesiastical preferment,
he was a bustling man of business, and ably filled the
office during a period of some thirty years. Of unflinching
devotion to his sovereign, sedate, stern in
the accomplishment of his duty, and obliged as he
was, in the interests of the crown, to exercise occasional
restraint on the rashness or presumption of the
conquerors, he incurred their enmity and was reviled
by their biographers. That he was retained so long
in office by such able monarchs as Ferdinand and
Charles goes far to prove invalid the charges of
misrule and villainy so liberally made against him.
Associated with Fonseca was Francisco Pinelo, as
treasurer, and Juan de Soria as <i>contador</i>, or auditor.
Their chief office was at Seville, with a custom-house
at Cádiz belonging to the same department. This
was the germ of the famous <i>Casa de Contratacion de
las Indias</i>, or India House of Trade, so long dominant
in the government of the New World.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SECOND VOYAGE.</div>

<p>
Thus all went swimmingly. Columbus found no
difficulty in fitting out a fleet for a second venture, a
royal order being issued that all captains, with their
ships and crews, in all the Andalusian ports, should
hold themselves in readiness for that purpose. Seventeen
vessels sailed from Cádiz the 25th of September,
1493, having on board twelve hundred persons,—miners,
mechanics, agriculturists, and gentlemen,—with
horses, cattle, sheep, goats, hogs, and fowls; the seeds
of vegetables, of orchard fruits, of oranges, lemons,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_169' href='#Page_169'>169</a></span>
and grain for planting; together with provisions, medicines,
implements, goods for trade, arms, ammunition,
and all the requirements for founding a colony. Among
the passengers were Diego Colon, the admiral's brother,
Bernal Diaz de Pisa, contador, Fermin Cedo, assayer,
and Alonso de Ojeda and Juan de la Cosa, subsequently
famous in New World discoveries; also twelve priests,
chief among whom was Bernardo Buil, a Benedictine
monk, sent by the pope as his apostolic vicar, with all
the ornaments and vestments for full service, which
always had a wonderful effect upon the natives. The
work of conversion had already been begun by baptizing
in solemn state the six savages brought over
by Columbus, Ferdinand and Isabella with Prince
Juan standing sponsors. The 3d of November the
expedition reached Dominica, so named from the day
of arrival, Sunday. Next was discovered an island
to which Columbus gave the name of his ship, <i>Marigalante</i>;
then Guadalupe, where were tamed geese,
and pine-apples, also human bones, significant of the
presence of the horror-breeding Caribs, or cannibals.
Thus cruising among these Caribbee Islands, and
naming them one after another, Columbus continued
his way and finally came to Navidad, only to find the
fortress in ruins, its former occupants having fallen
victims to their own follies.
</p>

<p>
Choosing a site a little to the east of Navidad, still
on the north side of Hayti, the Spaniards landed
their effects, and laid out a city, which they called
Isabela, surrounding it with ramparts. As soon as
the vessels could be laden with gold, they were to
be sent back to Spain; but the death of the Spaniards
left at Navidad had somewhat marred original
plans.
</p>

<p>
While Columbus lay ill, directing affairs as best
he might, early in January, 1494, two parties under
Ojeda and Gorvalan reconnoitred the island, each in
a different direction, and returning, reported gold. As
it was inconvenient to their anchorage, and as many
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_170' href='#Page_170'>170</a></span>
of the colonists were prostrate with disease, it was
deemed best to let the ships go back empty rather
than detain them longer; hence, on the 2d of February,
twelve of the largest craft put to sea under command
of Antonio de Torres, having on board further specimens
of the people and products of the country.
By this departure was sent a request for immediate
supplies.
</p>

<p>
Murmurs now arose against Columbus, the sick and
disappointed ones complaining most loudly that he
had deceived them, had lured them thither with false
hopes to die. And they begged Diaz de Pisa, already
at the head of a faction, and Cedo, who said there
was not gold in those isles in paying quantities, to
seize the remaining ships and sail with them for Spain.
But the admiral hearing of it, arrested Diaz, and held
him in irons on board one of the vessels to await trial
in Spain.
</p>

<p>
Recovered from illness, Columbus left his brother
Diego in command at Isabela, and set out, at the
head of four hundred men, for the golden mountains
of Cibao, in the interior of the island, intending
there to build a fortress, and to work the mines on
an extensive scale. Arrived at a favorable locality,
where gold seemed plentiful in the brooks, the Spaniards
threw up a strong wooden fort, which they
called Santo Tomás, a piece of pleasantry aimed
at the doubting assayer, Cedo. Leaving in command
Pedro Margarite, Columbus returned to Isabela.
Afterward a smaller post was built, called
Magdalena, and the command was given to Luis de
Arriaga.
</p>

<p>
The natives could not welcome so large an invasion,
which they now clearly saw would bring upon them
serious results. Thereupon they withdrew from the
vicinity of Santo Tomás, refusing all intercourse with
its inmates; and as a Spanish hidalgo could by no
means work, even at gold-gathering, success in that
direction was not marked. Provisions and medicine
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_171' href='#Page_171'>171</a></span>
then began to fail, and fresh discontent arose, even
Father Buil arraying himself in opposition to the
admiral.
</p>

<p>
As much to keep his people occupied as through
any expectation of profit, Columbus sent another
expedition into the interior of Hayti, and himself
crossed to the south side of Cuba in three caravels,
intending thence to reach Cathay. Soon he discovered
to the southward a lofty isle, which he called at
first Santa Gloria, then Santiago, but which finally
retained its native name, Jamaica, that is to say,
Island of Springs. After reaching nearly the western
end of Cuba, thinking it still the continent of
Asia, and that possibly he might by that way reach
Spain, in which event he could then see what was
beyond, he coasted the south sides of Jamaica and
Hayti, and returned to Isabela, where he arrived
insensible from excitement and fatigue. When he
awoke to bodily suffering, which for a time had been
drowned in delirious energy, there, to his great joy,
he found his brother Bartolomé, who had come from
Spain with three well-laden ships to his assistance.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">COLONIZATION A FAILURE.</div>

<p class="p2">
Great events generally choose great men for their
accomplishment, though not unfrequently we see no
small dust raised by an insignificant agent. As a
mariner and discoverer, Columbus had no superior;
as colonist and governor, he had by this time proved
himself a failure. There are some things great men
cannot do as well as their inferiors. It was one
thing to rule at sea, and quite another to rule on
shore. In bringing to his India these unruly Spaniards,
he had sown for himself the whirlwind. Had
he been more judicious in the selection of his followers,
his later days would have been more successful as well
as more peaceful. Discovery was his infatuation; he
was never for a moment unattended by a consuming
curiosity to find a western way to civilized India.
Had he been possessed of sound practical judgment
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_172' href='#Page_172'>172</a></span>
in the matter, of the same knowledge of himself and
of political affairs that he had of navigation, he would
have seen that he could not, at the same time, gratify
his passion for discovery and successfully govern colonies.
In his fatal desire to assume rulership, and
upon the ill-understood reports of simple savages,
with no knowledge of the resources or capabilities
of the country, without definite purpose or mature
plans, he had brought upon himself an avalanche
of woes. Beside his incapacity for such a task, his
position was rendered all the more trying by the
fact that he was a foreigner, whose arbitrary acts
galled his impatient subordinates, and finally wrought
them to the pitch of open rebellion. The Spaniards
were quick enough to perceive that this Genoese
sailor was in no wise fitted to lay the foundation of
a prosperous Spanish colony; and when during his
absence he left in command his brother, to whom
attached no prestige of high achievement to make
up for his misfortune in not being born in Spain,
complications grew daily worse. Even the ecclesiastics
were against the admiral; for with a foresight
born of a deep study of human nature they saw that
between the fires of the real and the unreal this man
was becoming mad. They saw the religious hypochondria,
which had already inflamed his intellect,
now aggravated by the anxieties incident to the government
of a turbulent element under circumstances
unprecedented, undermining his health, and bringing
rapidly upon him those mental and physical distempers
which rendered the remainder of his life prolonged
misery. Thus we may plainly see how Columbus
brought upon himself the series of calamities which
are commonly found charged to unscrupulous sovereigns
and villainous rivals.
</p>

<p>
And thickly enough misfortunes were laid upon
him on his return to Isabela. Margarite, who had
been ordered to explore the island, leaving Ojeda in
command at Santo Tomás, had abandoned himself to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_173' href='#Page_173'>173</a></span>
licentious idleness, followed by outrages upon the
natives, which notwithstanding their pacific disposition
had driven them to retaliation.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">TREATMENT OF THE NATIVES.</div>

<p>
And here was the beginning of these four centuries
of such rank injustice, such horrible atrocities inflicted
by the hand of the stronger upon the weaker,
of the civilized upon the savage, that should make
a man blush to own kinship to a race so defiled before
its maker in whose image it was created.
</p>

<p>
It is the self-same story, old and new, from
Española to Darien and Mexico, from Brazil to Labrador,
and from Patagonia to Alaska, by sailor and
cavalier, Spaniard and Englishman, by gold-hunter
and fur-hunter—the unenlightened red man welcoming
with wonder his destroyer, upon whom he is
soon forced to turn to save himself, his wife, his children,
but only at last to fall by the merciless arm
of development beneath the pitiable destiny of man
primeval.
</p>

<p>
Throwing off all pretence of allegiance to Columbus,
when satiated with his excesses, Margarite, with a
mutinous crew at his heels and accompanied by
Father Buil, had taken such ships as best suited
them and had departed for Spain. Two <i>caciques</i>, or
native chieftains, Guatiguana, and Caonabo the Carib,
with their followers had arisen in arms, had killed
some of the Spaniards, had besieged Magdalena and
Santo Tomás, and had even cast an ominous eye on
Isabela. Such were the chief occurrences at the settlement
during the absence of the admiral.
</p>

<p>
First of all, Columbus made his brother Bartolomé
<i>adelantado</i>, that is to say, leader of an enterprise,
or governor of a frontier province. Then he sent
relief to the fortress of Magdalena, and established
another military post near where was subsequently
Santiago, which he called Concepcion. Later the
chain was continued by building other posts; one near
the Rio Yaquí, called Santa Catalina, and one on
the river Yaquí, called Esperanza. Meanwhile Ojeda
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_174' href='#Page_174'>174</a></span>
offered to take the redoubtable Carib, Caonabo, by
stratagem; which was accomplished, while he was
surrounded by a multitude of warriors, by first winning
the admiration and confidence of the cacique,
and then on the plea of personal ornamentation and
display obtaining his consent to wear some beautiful
bright manacles, and sit bound behind Ojeda on his
steed; in which plight he was safely brought by the
dashing cavalier at the head of his horsemen into
Isabela.
</p>

<p>
About this time Antonio de Torres arrived with
four ships from Spain, and was sent back with the
gold which had been collected, and five hundred
Indians to be sold as slaves. By this departure
went Diego Colon to refute the charges of incompetency
and maladministration now being preferred
against his brother at court.
</p>

<p>
Though suffering from a fresh attack of fever, on
the 27th of March, 1495, accompanied by the adelantado
and all his available forces, Columbus set
out from Isabela to subjugate the caciques of the
island, who had combined to extirpate the Spaniards.
Charging the naked red men amidst the noise of drum,
trumpet, and halloo, with horse and bloodhound,
lance, sabre, and firelock, a peace was soon conquered.
Multitudes of the inhabitants were butchered,
and upon the rest was imposed such cruel tribute
that they gradually sank beneath the servitude. But
when the white men thus had the domain to themselves,
they did not know what to do with it. It was
not for them to till the soil, or labor in the mines;
hence famine threatened, and they were finally reduced
to the last extremity.
</p>

<p>
There is little wonder, under the circumstances,
that orders were issued in Spain to depose Columbus,
first by the appointment of a commission of inquiry,
and finally by removal.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">GOVERNMENT OF THE INDIES.</div>

<p>
Thus far the government of the Indies, as the
New World began to be called, had been administered
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_175' href='#Page_175'>175</a></span>
solely by the admiral, according to agreement, with
Fonseca as superintendent in Spain. None but they
were permitted to freight or despatch any vessel to the
New World. Columbus was authorized to appoint
two subordinate officers subject to royal sanction;
and yet the sovereigns took offense when he named
Bartolomé adelantado, which office was not that of
lieutenant-governor, as many writers aver, but nearer
that of territorial governor, with political as well as
military powers, usually appointed by and subject
only to the king. Assuming a certain degree of state,
the admiral appeared at Isabela richly dressed, with
ten <i>escuderos de á pié</i>, or squires of foot, and twenty
<i>familiares</i>, composing his civil and military family.
He had been directed before leaving Spain to appoint
in each of the several settlements or colonies which
should be planted an <i>alcalde</i>, or justice, exercising
the combined duties of mayor and judge, with jurisdiction
in civil and criminal cases, appeal being to the
admiral; also an <i>alguacil mayor</i>, or high sheriff; and,
if necessary, an <i>ayuntamiento</i>, or town council. All
edicts, orders, and commissions must be issued in
the name of the sovereigns, countersigned by the
notary, with the royal seal affixed. The admiral had
been further directed to build a warehouse where
the royal stores should be kept, and all traffic should
be subject to his direction. When he sailed upon
his Cuban expedition he left for the direction of
the colony a junta, of which his brother Diego was
president, and Alonso Sanchez Carvajal, Juan de
Luxan, Pedro Fernandez Coronel, and Father Buil,
councillors.
</p>

<p>
Diego Colon was a well-meaning man, gentle and
discreet, approaching in visage and dress nearer the
priest than the cavalier; he was neither shrewd nor
energetic. Bartolomé was quite the opposite, and in
many respects was the ablest of the brothers. Powerful
in mind and body, authoritative and determinate
in demeanor, generous in disposition, fearless in spirit,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_176' href='#Page_176'>176</a></span>
a thorough seaman, a man of no narrow worldly
experience, fairly educated, and talented with the
pen, he was neither the amiable, inefficient Diego,
nor the dreamy, enthusiastic admiral.
</p>

<p>
Quick to notice in their deputy any indication of
misrule, or undue assumption of authority, their
Majesties did not fail to lend an attentive ear to the
charges preferred against him. Yet the record does
not show from first to last that either Isabella or
Ferdinand ever really desired or intended to do
Columbus injustice or injury. When Torres returned
from Spain, after the first accusation had been made,
the sovereigns, besides a letter expressing the warmest
confidence in the discoverer, and high consideration
for the affairs of the colony, sent a special <i>real
provision</i> ordering all to obey the admiral as
themselves, under penalty of ten thousand maravedís
for every offence. When further accusations
came, instead of divesting him of his authority,
they sent as commissioner of inquiry Juan Aguado,
a warm friend of the admiral. Often they checked
Fonseca's too harsh measures with regard to Columbus
and his brothers, and interposed their royal
protection from such officers as acted too severely
under the exasperating folly of the admiral. To
satisfy the discoverer would have been impossible for
any patron, so wild were his desires, so chimerical
his plans, so injudicious his acts.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Aguado arrived at Isabela in October. He
brought four caravels laden with supplies, and Diego
Colon, passenger. Soon it was noised abroad that
the conduct of the admiral was to be questioned,
whereat both white men and red rejoiced. Aguado
could but see the pitiable state of things upon the
island, idleness, poverty, excesses, and disobedience
among the colonists, folly and mismanagement among
the rulers, and seeing, could but report accordingly;
for which, and for no other reasons that I am able to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_177' href='#Page_177'>177</a></span>
discover, the biographers of Columbus heap upon the
commissioner opprobrious epithets.
</p>

<p>
When Aguado returned to Spain, Columbus accompanied
him to make such excuses before the
sovereigns as best he might. They embarked from
Isabela March 10, 1496, leaving the adelantado in
command, and carrying with them two hundred and
twenty-five disaffected colonists, and a number of
Indian captives, among whom was the proud and
once powerful chieftain, Caonabo, so treacherously
taken by Ojeda. Contrary winds and starvation
attended them, Caonabo dying during the voyage.
Arrived at Cádiz in June, the admiral found Pedro
Alonso Niño about to sail with three caravels for
Hayti. Niño carried out more priests, and brought
back more slaves.
</p>

<p>
Columbus appeared in Spain in a Franciscan garb
and with dejected demeanor. To all the world,
except to himself, it was by this time evident that
his gorgeous India was a myth, and settlement on
the supposition of its existence a mistake. He
seemed now dazed by reverses, as formerly he had
been dazed by successes. Nevertheless, he continued
to make as much as possible of his discoveries,
parading a brother of Caonabo in a broad gold
collar with a massive gold chain attached.
</p>

<p>
Still the sovereigns were gracious. They scarcely
alluded to the complaints and ever-increasing charges
against the admiral, but confirmed anew his dignities,
enlarged his perquisites, and showed him every kindness.
The title of adelantado was formally vested
by them in Bartolomé. When asked for more ships
and money, they readily granted both; moreover,
they offered the admiral a tract of land in Hayti,
twenty-five by fifty leagues, which, however, he
declined; they offered him sixty sailors, a hundred
and forty soldiers, one hundred miners, mechanics,
and farmers, and thirty women, the services of
all to be paid by the crown. But because there
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_178' href='#Page_178'>178</a></span>
was some delay, occasioned by the operations in
Italy and the armada for Flanders, the biographers
of the admiral again break out in abuse of the
sovereigns and their servants. The truth is, Ferdinand
and Isabella stood by the Genoese much
longer than did their subjects. For example, when
certain millions of maravedís, equivalent to over a
hundred thousand dollars to-day, had been appropriated,
and eight vessels equipped, so unpopular had the
admiral and his enterprises become, that it was found
necessary to press sailors into the service, and empty
the prisons for colonists. And it was only when
their admiral, viceroy, and governor of the Indies so
far forgot himself, when on the point of sailing, as
publicly, and with his own hand and foot, to strike
down and kick Jimeno de Berviesca, an official under
Fonseca, that the sovereigns began to realize the
unfitness of Columbus for the management of colonies.
It was a serious offense to attack a public
servant; and when this was done under the very
eyes of royalty, and by the man they had so delighted
to honor, the truth came home to them,
and they never afterward regarded the Genoese with
the same degree of favor. Yet for his great merits,
his genius, enthusiasm, and perseverance, and for the
glory unparalleled conferred by him on Spain, they
would ever be to him just and generous. He could
never become again the pauper pilot, as he had been
called at Granada while begging help for his first
voyage.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">THIRD VOYAGE.</div>

<p class="p2">
Two vessels were despatched to the colony under
Pedro Fernandez Coronel early in 1498. On the
30th of May Columbus embarked from San Lúcar
with six vessels, arrived at the northern seaboard
of South America, and discovered there the isle of
Trinidad the 31st of July, sailed through the gulf
of Paria, where gold and pearls were seen in profusion,
discovered the Margarita Islands, and came to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_179' href='#Page_179'>179</a></span>
Hayti, arriving off the river Ozema, on the southern
side of the island, the 30th of August.
</p>

<p>
Prior to the last departure of the admiral for
Spain, gold had been discovered in this vicinity,
and during his absence a military post, called San
Cristóbal, had been planted there, and at the
adjacent harbor a fort built, which was named
Santo Domingo, and which was from this time
the capital of the Indies. At intervals during the
past two years, the adelantado at the head of his
marauders had scoured the island, collecting the
quarterly tribute, and making observation on such
measures as he thought might increase the same.
Insurrections had been occasionally organized by the
caciques, but were usually stifled by the prompt
and politic action of the adelantado. Many of the
colonists had gradually relaxed in their loyalty to
Columbus, until finally, at the instigation of Francisco
Roldan, they declared their independence of
the adelantado, though still acknowledging fealty to
Spain. After creating no small disturbance about
Concepcion and Isabela, Roldan had retired with his
band to the province of Jaraguá.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">AFFAIRS AT SANTO DOMINGO.</div>

<p>
On landing at Santo Domingo, the admiral first
proclaimed his approval of the adelantado's measures,
and then set about to pacify the colonists. With the
common people, many officers of trust had joined the
revolt of Roldan. Columbus offered amnesty to all,
which was at first refused, and letters from both
sides were sent to Spain. But at length there was
reconciliation; Roldan became a partisan of Columbus,
and assisted in subduing other hostile factions,
which resulted in flinging Adrian de Moxica off the
battlements of Fort Concepcion.
</p>

<p>
The distracted state of the colony, the continued
charges against Columbus, and the inadequate
returns from large outlays, impelled the sovereigns
to send out another commission with power to punish
offenders, civil and criminal, and, if necessary, to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_180' href='#Page_180'>180</a></span>
supersede the admiral in the government. The commissioner
chosen for this purpose was Francisco de
Bobadilla, an arrogant, shallow-minded man, who
delighted rather in degrading merit than in exercising
justice. He was authorized by letters patent to
acquaint himself concerning the truth of the rebellion
against the admiral; what robberies, cruelties, or
other overt acts had been committed; he was directed
to seize the person and sequestrate the property
of any offender, or punish in any way he might
deem best. A provisional letter was addressed by
the sovereigns to the admiral of the ocean sea,
ordering him to surrender to the commissioner all forts,
arms, ships, houses, cattle, or other public property,
which letter was to be used only if necessary.
Bobadilla, accompanied by a body-guard of twenty-five
men, sailed with two caravels in July, 1500, and
arrived at Santo Domingo on the 23d of August.
By this opportunity some of the Indians sent over
by Columbus as slaves were returned in charge of
six friars. It is doubtful whether the enslavement
of the red man could ever have been made profitable,
but whether it could or not, the Catholic Church is
entitled to much credit for thus promptly setting its
foot upon the diabolical traffic which had already
received the approval of some of the first jurists of
the day. Indeed the doctrine that the Indians were
not endowed with souls was rapidly spreading, and
had found many believers, and had not the pope
fortunately at this juncture decided against the proposition,
the subject of Indian slavery would not have
been so easily or so quickly settled.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">UNWARRANTED CONDUCT OF BOBADILLA.</div>

<p>
Among the first objects to meet the eye of Bobadilla,
on landing, were the bodies of two Spaniards
swinging from gibbets, which argued not very
favorably for the quietude of the island. Columbus
was absent at Fort Concepcion; the adelantado and
Roldan were pursuing rebels in Jaraguá; Diego
Colon, who was in charge at Santo Domingo, was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_181' href='#Page_181'>181</a></span>
peremptorily commanded to surrender certain prisoners,
which he refused to do until the admiral,
whose commission was higher than that of Bobadilla,
and under whom he served, should order it.
</p>

<p>
Thereupon Bobadilla broke open the jail, and the
prisoners were finally set at liberty. He not only
assumed the custody of the crown property, but
he entered the house of Columbus, took possession
of his effects, and made his residence there. He
sided with the late insurgents, giving ear only to
them. Next he ordered to appear before him the
admiral, who came with all quietness, and was
immediately ironed and cast into prison. The brothers
of Columbus met the same fate. It was a
most villainous proceeding on the part of Bobadilla,
wholly unauthorized, wholly unnecessary. Columbus
was condemned before he was tried. While in the
act of coming forward of his own accord, not with
hostile front, but unattended, he was seized, manacled,
and incarcerated. It was not until afterward
that he was charged with inflicting on the colonists,
even on hidalgos, oppressive labor, abuse, and cruel
punishments; with failing to provide them sufficient
food; with opposing royal authority; with secreting
gold and pearls; and with unjust treatment of the
natives, making unnecessary war upon them, levying
iniquitous tribute, preventing their conversion, and
sending them as slaves to Spain. Some went so far
as to hint at an intended transfer of allegiance to
some other power. But were all the calumnies true,
twice told, which vile, revengeful men had heaped
upon him, he would not have merited the treatment
that he now received at the hand of their Majesties'
agent. Ever loyal, high-minded, and sincere, ever
performing his duties to the best of his ability, the
worst that can be truthfully said of him is that he
was unfitted by temperament and training, unfitted
by his genius, by those very qualities which made
him so superior to other men in other directions, for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_182' href='#Page_182'>182</a></span>
organizing in a tropical wilderness that social thrift
upon which might be built a staid community out of
the ignorant, presumptuous, and desperate element
fresh from conflicts with Jews and Moors.
</p>

<p>
After having been subjected to much insult and
indignity, the three brothers were placed on shipboard
and sent to Spain. Andrés Martin, master of
the caravel, offered to remove the manacles, but the
admiral said no. It was by the king's agent the
irons were put on; it must be by the king's order if
ever they are taken off. "And I will always keep
these chains," he added with proud bitterness, "as
memorials of reward for faithful services."
</p>

<p>
Both Ferdinand and Isabella and all the people
were shocked to see the illustrious discoverer in such
a plight. Immediately the sovereigns heard of it the
chains were stricken off, and the prisoners released.
From the odious abasement into which he had been
unjustly thrust by an infamous agent, Columbus was
once more lifted high into favor by the sovereigns,
whose moist eyes testified their hearts' sincerity.

<p>
The first Spaniard to touch the territory which
for the purposes of my work I have taken the liberty
to denominate the Pacific States of North America
was Rodrigo de Bastidas, a notary of Triana, the
gypsy suburb of Seville.
</p>
<div class="sidenote">THE NEW WORLD OPENED TO SETTLEMENT.</div>
<p>
Although the discoveries of Columbus had been
made for Castile, and Castilians regarded their rights
to the new lands superior to those of any others, even
other inhabitants of Spain; and although at first
none might visit the New World save those authorized
by Columbus or Fonseca; yet, owing to inadequate
returns from heavy expenditures, and the
inability of the admiral properly to control colonization
in the several parts of the ever-widening area,
at the solicitation of several persons desirous of entering
the new field of commerce and adventure at
their own charge, on the 10th of April, 1495, the
sovereigns issued a proclamation granting native-born
subjects of Spain permission to settle in Hayti,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_184' href='#Page_184'>184</a></span>
or Española,<a id='FA_III-1' href='#FN_III-1' class='fnanchor'>[III-1]</a> as I shall continue to call the island,
and to make to other parts private voyages of discovery
and trade, under royal license. The regulations
were that the vessels so sailing should be
equipped under royal inspection, that they should
depart only from the port of Cádiz, and that they
should carry one or two crown officers. The sovereigns
retained, without payment, one tenth of the
tonnage, and were to receive one tenth of the gross
returns. Settlers on Española were to receive grants
of land, and one year's provision; of the gold they
gathered they were to pay two thirds to the crown;
on all other products one tenth. Although this step
was taken without consulting Columbus, it was the
aim of the sovereigns fully to respect his rights in
the matter; therefore, and in lieu of his property in
one eighth of all the tonnage, for every seven vessels
thus privately adventured he was privileged to despatch
one on his own account. The admiral still
complaining, such parts of the proclamation as in
any wise interfered with his rights were revoked,
and his former privileges confirmed, the 2d of June,
1497.<a id='FA_III-2' href='#FN_III-2' class='fnanchor'>[III-2]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_185' href='#Page_185'>185</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Among those to take advantage of this permission,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_186' href='#Page_186'>186</a></span>
beside Bastidas, was Alonso de Ojeda, who embarked
with four vessels from Spain in May, 1499, in company
with Juan de la Cosa and Amerigo Vespucci,
sailed along the seaboard of South America from
Paria and the Pearl Coast, discovered by Columbus,
to the gulf of Venezuela, so called because like
Venice the native villages were built over the water.
At Cape de la Vela, Ojeda left the coast and crossed
to Española, whence he was driven off by Roldan
at the command of Columbus. He reached Spain in
June, 1500; and though his ships were crowded with
slaves, after paying expenses there were left but five
hundred ducats to divide among fifty-five persons.
Sailing in a caravel of only fifty tons, a few days
later than Ojeda, were Pedro Alonso Niño and
Cristóbal Guerra, who, following the track of Columbus
and Ojeda to the Pearl Coast, thence crossed to
Margarita, returned to the main-land and coasted
Cumaná, and finally returned to Spain, arriving
about two months before Ojeda, well laden with gold
and pearls. This was the first really profitable
voyage, pecuniarily, to the New World. Then there
was Vicente Yañez Pinzon, who sailed in four
caravels in December, 1499, and shortly after Diego
de Lepe, in two vessels, both going to Brazil.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">VOYAGE OF BASTIDAS.</div>

<p class="p2">
Quite exceptional to the ordinary adventurer was
Bastidas. He was a man of standing in the community,
possessed of some means himself and having
wealthy friends; he was intelligent and influential,
and withal humane, even Las Casas admitting that
no one ever accused him of illtreating the Indians.
</p>

<p>
The friends of the honest notary, among them
Juan de Ledesma, were ready enough to join him,
pecuniarily, in a venture to the famous Pearl Coast,
as the South American shore of the admiral's third
voyage was now called. Obtaining from Fonseca's
office a royal license,<a id='FA_III-3' href='#FN_III-3' class='fnanchor'>[III-3]</a> and enlisting the coöperation
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_187' href='#Page_187'></a></span>
of Juan de la Cosa, already veteran in western
pilotage, Bastidas equipped two caravels,<a id='FA_III-4' href='#FN_III-4' class='fnanchor'>[III-4]</a> embarked
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_188' href='#Page_188'></a></span>
at Cádiz in October, 1500, took on board wood,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_189' href='#Page_189'></a></span>
water, meat, and cheese at Gomera, and steering a
little north of the admiral's last track, came to a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_190' href='#Page_190'>190</a></span>
green isle, which he called Isla Verde, and reached
the mainland near Venezuela. Coasting westward,
he passed Santa Marta, and arrived at the Magdalena
River in March, 1501, so naming it on arrival
from the day, which was that of the woman's conversion.
There he narrowly escaped shipwreck.
Continuing, and trading on the way, he found the
ports of Zamba and Coronados—the latter so called
because the natives wore large crowns—the islands of
San Bernardo, Barú, and the Arenas, off Cartagena
Bay. Next he saw Fuerte and tenantless Tortuga,
touched at the port of Cenú, passed Point Caribana,
entered the gulf of Urabá, and saw the <i>farallones</i>,
or craggy islet peaks, rising abruptly from the water
near the Darien shore. Thus far from Cape de la
Vela he had discovered one hundred and fifty
leagues<a id='FA_III-5' href='#FN_III-5' class='fnanchor'>[III-5]</a> of new seaboard. And because when the
tide was low the water was fresh, he called the
place Golfo Dulce. Thus came the Spaniards upon
the isthmus that unites the two Americas; and
along it they sailed to Point Manzanilla, in which
vicinity were El Retrete and Nombre de Dios.<a id='FA_III-6' href='#FN_III-6' class='fnanchor'>[III-6]</a>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">GLORIES OF THE ISTHMUS.</div>

<p>
It is a balmy beginning, this of these men from
Spain, of that intercontinental commerce which is
shortly to bring destruction on one side and retrogression
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_191' href='#Page_191'>191</a></span>
on the other; a commerce which shall end
only with the next general cataclysm. Threading
their way among islands smothered in foliage, which
seemed upon the glossy water-surface as floating
fragments of the thickly matted verdure of the mainland,
listening to notes unfamiliar to their ears, and
seeing these strange men and women so like and yet
so unlike Spaniards, they find themselves wondering
whether they are in the world or out of it. We
who so well know our little planet and its ways can
scarcely imagine what it was in the darkness to be
taken up at Seville, and put down amidst the magic
play of light and shade at Darien. Probably now
the world was round; yet still it might be fungiform,
or crescent-shaped, or amorphous, having a smooth or
ragged edge, from which a fearful slipping-off might
any moment ensue. All they can know is what they
see, and that they cannot half know, for they can
scarcely more than half see or feel or smell. Some
part of the perpendicular rays of the incandescent sun
falling on their toughened skins they can feel; some
part of the water that from the surcharged reservoirs
of low-lying clouds so frequently and freely pours upon
the spot whence it is pumped by this same vertical
sun. They can turn their bewildered eyes toward
the south and see beyond its clean white border the
mainland stretching off in billows of burnished green
to the far-away hazy horizon, where like a voluptuous
beauty it imprints a kiss upon the blushing sky; they
may lie in the gray mist of evening and dream, and
dream, their minds—how many removes from the
intelligence of the impatient sea and the self-tuned
life upon the shore? Or they may drift about in the
amber light of a soft vaporous morning without much
dreaming; one thing at least to them is real, and
that is gold. Without the aid of divine revelation
they fathom the difference between the precious solid
substance and hollow brass. So do the savages,
thinking the latter much the prettier; and thus
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_192' href='#Page_192'>192</a></span>
both sides, each believing the others fools and well
cheated, are happy in their traffic. The Spaniards
are enchanted less by the lovely garb in which nature
everywhere greets them than by the ease with which
the golden harvest is gathered. Thus all betokens
the most flattering success when a luckless event
casts a shadow over their bright fortunes.
</p>

<p>
The two ships were found to be leaking badly.
An examination was made, when the bottoms were
found pierced by teredos;<a id='FA_III-7' href='#FN_III-7' class='fnanchor'>[III-7]</a> and thus before they knew
it their vessels were unfit for service. Hoping still
to reach Cádiz, Bastidas immediately set sail, touched
at Jamaica for wood and water, and continued his
voyage as far as Contramaestre, an islet one league
distant from Española, where he was obliged to
anchor and repair his ships. Again embarking for
Spain, he was met by a gale which threw him back
upon the island. Buffeted in a second attempt, he
ran the ships for safety into the little port of Jaraguá,
where they filled and sank, the loss in vessels, slaves,
Brazil-wood, cloth, and gold, being not less than five
millions of maravedís.<a id='FA_III-8' href='#FN_III-8' class='fnanchor'>[III-8]</a> For notwithstanding the estimable
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_193' href='#Page_193'>193</a></span>
reputation for piety, justice, and humanity
which he has always borne, the good Bastidas did not
scruple gently to entrap on board his ships, along the
shore of Darien, several scores of unsuspecting natives,
to be sold as slaves; nor, having thus exercised his
virtues in the klopemania of the day, did he scruple
to abandon with his sinking ships the greater portion
of these innocent wretches in order to save the more of
his gold, which was deemed of greater proximate and
certain value than the bodies or even the souls of the
heathen.
</p>

<p>
Thus observing everywhere, as perforce we must
as we proceed, the magnanimity and high morality
with which our so prized and petted civilization greeted
weak, defenseless, and inoffensive savagism, we are
prepared when shipwrecked mariners are thrown upon
a distant isle inhabited by their own countrymen, subjects
of the same sovereigns—we are prepared by their
reception, which we shall presently see, to exclaim with
uplifted hands, Behold, how these brethren love one
another!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_194' href='#Page_194'>194</a></span>
</p>

<p>
After burning superfluous ammunition, the Spaniards
gathered up their valuables, and placing them
on the backs of such captives as for that purpose
they had kindly permitted to live, set out in three
divisions over separate routes, so as to secure a more
liberal supply of provisions on the way, for Santo
Domingo, distant seventy leagues. In his license, as
we have seen, Bastidas was authorized to trade only
in lands discovered by himself. But on the way his
followers with their trinkets had purchased food from
the natives; for which offence, on his arrival at Santo
Domingo, Bastidas was seized by Bobadilla and cast
into prison. In vain did all the shipwrecked company
protest that they had bought only such articles
as were necessary for their nourishment during the
march. To their affirmations the governor turned a
deaf ear; and as Bobadilla was about to depart for
Spain, the notary was ordered thither for trial, sailing
in July, 1502.
</p>

<p>
Before the sovereigns Bastidas found no difficulty
in justifying his conduct; and so rich were the returns
from his traffic with the natives of Darien,
that notwithstanding the unfortunate termination of
the adventure he was enabled to pay a large sum
into the royal treasury. For their important successes,
to Rodrigo de Bastidas was awarded an annual
pension of fifty thousand maravedís, and to Juan de
la Cosa a similar sum with the title of alguacil mayor
of Urabá, all to be paid them out of returns from the
new lands which they had found. "Such," remarks
Irving, "was the economical generosity of King
Ferdinand, who rewarded the past toils of his adventurous
discoverers out of the expected produce
of their future labors."<a id='FA_III-9' href='#FN_III-9' class='fnanchor'>[III-9]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_195' href='#Page_195'>195</a></span>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">ARCHIVES OF THE INDIES.</div>

<p class="p2 blockquot">
The most fertile source of information relative to the early affairs of
America is the <i>Archives of the Indies</i>, a general term comprising various collections
in various places. From this source many writers have drawn, and
are still drawing; many documents have been printed, and many yet remain to
be printed. Altogether the collections are very numerous, as the government
required full records, and in some cases copies, to be kept of official documents
concerning discovery, conquest, and settlement. The several council-chambers
and public offices where the business was transacted were the first depositories
of these papers, the chief places then being Seville, Cádiz, and Madrid.
In 1566 Philip II. ordered all collections, ecclesiastic and secular, to be
united, and deposited in the fortress of Simancas. Again in 1717, when all
the councils were consolidated in one, Felipe V., who founded the <i>Academia
de la Historia</i>, among other things for the gathering and preserving of materials
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_196' href='#Page_196'>196</a></span>
for history, directed all papers to be conveyed annually to the <i>Archivo
de Simancas</i>. These provisions could not have been fully carried out, or
else a very extensive system of copying must have been practised; for later,
when the Archives were thrown open to the search of historians, the accumulation
at Simancas, though large, did not appear to be much greater than at
some other places. Further than this, there were family archives in the
houses of those who had played prominent parts in public affairs, and ecclesiastical
relaciones in the convents of the several orders, of little less importance
than public records. And while the government insisted on the making of
complete records, and observed great care in preventing their contents from
being known, especially to foreigners, little pains was taken to preserve them
from damage or destruction, or to arrange them for convenient reference.
Therefore when they came to light it was in the form of bulky masses of
unassorted, worm-eaten, and partially illegible papers. Many documents,
mentioned by contemporary writers, are known to have been lost, and their
contents blotted from existence. Fernando VI., 1746-1759, commissioned
Burriel and Santiago Palomares to examine the archives of the kingdom and
to copy and form into a collection such of the manuscripts as they should
deem best. This collection was placed in the <i>Biblioteca Nacional</i> at Madrid.
Other collections were made during the two following reigns by Abella,
Traggia, Velazquez, Muñoz, Navarrete, Sans, Vargas Ponce, and Villanueva,
which found lodgment in various localities.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
The early chroniclers of the Indies picked up their knowledge as best they
might, by observation, by conversation, and by the examination of written
evidence. Las Casas and Oviedo spent much time in the New World; Peter
Martyr had access to whatever existed, beside talking with everybody who
had been to America; Gomara copied much from Oviedo. Everything was
at the disposal of Herrera as crown historiographer, as a matter of course,
though he did not always make the best use of his opportunities. Gashard
affirms that both Cabrera and Herrera were ignorant of the existence of many
of the most valuable documents of their day. Ramusio, Hakluyt, Purchas,
and others, succeeded in getting now and then an original paper on the
Indies to print in their several collections. Among the first English historians
who attempted for purposes of history to utilize the Archives of the
Indies was William Robertson, who published the <i>History of the Reign of
the Emperor Charles</i>, London, 1769; and in 1777, his <i>History of America</i>, 2
vols. 4to, several editions appearing subsequently also in 8vo. Robertson was
a Scotch clergyman of great learning and ability. His style was elegant and
vigorous, and he was by far the most philosophic writer on America up to his
time. Although his statements are full of errors, intensified by dogmatism,
but for which he cannot always be blamed, all who have come after him
have profited by his writings; and some of these, indeed, have reaped richer
rewards than he to whom they owed their success, and with far less labor.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">ROBERTSON AND MUÑOZ.</div>

<p class="blockquot">
Early in his work Mr Robertson applied to the proper authorities at
Madrid, Vienna, and St Petersburg for access to material. Germany and
Russia responded in a spirit of liberality, but Spain would none of it. In
1775 Robertson ascertained that the largest room occupied by the <i>Archivos de
Simancas</i> was filled with American papers, in 873 bundles; that they were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_197' href='#Page_197'>197</a></span>
concealed from strangers with solicitous care, Spanish subjects even being
denied access without an order from the crown; and that no copies could be
obtained except upon the payment of exorbitant fees. However, through
the assistance of Lord Grantham, English ambassador at Madrid, and by
preparing a set of questions to be submitted to persons who had lived in
America, much new and important information was elicited, and copies of
certain manuscripts were obtained. The letters of Cortés, and the writings
of Motolinia, Mendieta, and others, which Robertson used in manuscript,
have since been printed.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
It is greatly to be regretted that the learned Juan Bautista Muñoz did
not live to complete his <i>Historia del Nuevo Mundo</i>, only the first volume of
which appeared. This was published in Madrid, in 1793, bringing his work
down to 1500. Muñoz was born near Valencia in 1745, graduated at the University,
and in 1779 was commissioned by the king to write a history of
America, all public and private material being placed at his disposal by royal
order. Many papers were wanting in the archives of the department of the
Indies in Madrid; whereupon he went to Simancas, Seville, Cádiz, and other
towns, armed with a royal <i>cédula</i>, which opened to him family and monastic
accumulations as well as all public depositories. So great was the confusion
in which he found the royal archives, that it seemed to him as if they had
been disarranged purposely to hide what they contained. Even in the indices
of the <i>Archivo Secreto del Consejo de Indias</i> there was scarcely any indication
of papers belonging to the earlier American periods. Nevertheless, by persistent
search, mass after mass of rich material was unearthed in the secret
archives as well as in the <i>Real Casa Audiencia de la Contratacion</i>, the archives
at Simancas, the royal libraries of Madrid and the Escorial, the <i>Contaduría
Principal</i> of the <i>Audiencia de Indias</i> in Cádiz, the <i>Archivo General de Portugal</i>,
the monastery of Monserrate, the colleges of San Bartolomé and
Cuenca at Salamanca, and San Gregorio at Valladolid, the cathedral of
Palencia, the Sacromonte of Granada, and in the convents of San Francisco
of Tolosa in Guipúzcoa, Santo Domingo of Málaga, and San Acacio, San
José, and San Isidro del Campo of Seville, until it may be said of him that
his efforts were buried beneath the magnitude of their invocation. Then it
was that he found he had undertaken greater things than he could accomplish.
Even with the aid of government he could not master the confused
masses; for money and men unlimited cannot accomplish everything without
time. The indefatigable Muñoz worked faithfully; the king complained of
the meagre results; the author died doing his best, and his work to this day
remains undone. During his labors he made an extensive collection of papers,
memorials, and other manuscripts relating to America, known as the <i>Coleccion
de Muñoz</i>, which he once intended to publish, but this with a portion of his
history was left in manuscript. Irving states that the papers of Muñoz were
left with Señor Uguina, and Ternaux-Compans claims to have obtained all of
Uguina's manuscripts; but Prescott asserts that the collection of Muñoz was
deposited in the archives of the Royal Academy of History at Madrid, and
was there augmented by the manuscripts of Vargas Ponce, obtained chiefly
from the archives of the Indies at Seville. Prior to 1793 the <i>Archivo General
de Indias</i> was established at Seville, and a large quantity of old papers conveyed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_198' href='#Page_198'>198</a></span>
thither from Madrid and Simancas. About 1810 the archives at
Simancas were sacked by Napoleon; in 1814 the remnant was re-arranged and
classified.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
Before the death of Muñoz, Navarrete was commissioned by the king to
search the archives for documents relating to the doings of the Spanish navy.
By him personally, or under his direction when occupied in other duties, the
search was continued from 1789 to 1825. The results of these labors were
as follows: before 1793, twenty-four folio volumes of copies from the Royal
Library at Madrid, the collections of the marquises of Santa Cruz and of
Villafranca, of the dukes de Medina Sidonia and del Infantado, and from
the <i>Biblioteca de los estudios reales de San Isidro</i>, and the <i>Biblioteca alta del
Escorial</i>; after 1793, seventeen volumes of copies from the <i>Archivo General
de Indias</i>, including the papers in the <i>Casa de Contratacion</i> in Seville, the
<i>Colegio de San Telmo</i>, the <i>Biblioteca de San Acacio</i>, and from the collection
of the Conde del Aguila. With this material, increased by subsequent
researches in the libraries of the Royal Academy of History in Madrid, and
other public institutions, and in many private collections, particularly that
of the Duke of Veraguas, and with access to the Muñoz collection, Navarrete
began in 1825 the publication of his <i>Coleccion de los Viages y Descubrimientos,
que hicieron por mar los Españoles desde fines del Siglo</i> XV., in 5 vols.,
Madrid, 1825-37, in which he printed over 500 documents, many of them of
the highest importance. As this collection constitutes one of the chief
authorities upon the early affairs of Darien, a brief notice of the author may
not be out of place.

<div class="sidenote">MARTIN FERNANDEZ DE NAVARRETE.</div>

Martin Fernandez de Navarrete was born in 1765 in Ábalos in old Castile.
He entered the seminary of Vergara in 1777, where he studied Latin and
mathematics and displayed some literary taste. In 1780 he joined the navy,
was stationed first as a midshipman at Ferrol, joined Córdoba's squadron in
1781, and cruised in the summer of that year on the English coast. He did
good service before Gibraltar in September, 1782, and in the battle off Cape
Espartel the 20th of October following. In 1783, having been promoted to a
naval ensigncy, he was appointed to the Cartagena department, and cruised
in consequence against the Moors during the years 1784-5. On the close of
the Algerine wars he studied the higher mathematics, navigation, and
manœuvring with Gabriel de Císcar, distinguishing himself in these branches.
In 1789, his health forcing him to quit active service, he was commissioned
by Carlos IV. to examine the archives of the kingdom and collect manuscripts
relating to marine history; a work for which his zeal and knowledge
particularly fitted him. This was the beginning of his famous Collection of
Voyages, although its first volumes did not appear till thirty-six years after.
When the war broke out between France and Spain in 1793, he joined the
squadron commanded by Juan de Lángara, who appointed him his chief aid,
<i>primer ayudante</i>, and secretary. He was still at sea, in 1796, when war was
declared against England; but in 1797, Lángara being named minister of
marine, and unwilling to lose his young secretary, he brought him to Madrid,
giving him a place in the department. Here, in 1802, Navarrete published,
as a preface to the <i>Relacion del Viage hecho por las goletas Sutil y Mexicana</i>,
a résumé of Spanish discoveries on the Californian and Northwest coasts,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_199' href='#Page_199'>199</a></span>
that has been much cited in the English-American disputes about the Oregon
boundary. Meanwhile his merits were recognized in Madrid. In 1807 he
was named <i>ministro fiscal</i> of the supreme council of the admiralty court, he
holding already the rank of captain. But in this year came the French invasion,
overturning all things. Madrid fell in 1808. In 1812 Navarrete was
found in Cádiz; in 1814 in Murcia. Fernando regained his throne, however,
May 14, 1814; four months after which event Navarrete returned to Madrid.
In 1815 he proposed from his place in the Spanish Academy that new system
of orthography which has been adopted for its dictionary. He interested
himself also in the fine arts, and as secretary of the Academy of San Fernando
contributed many valuable papers to its Transactions. Soon after his return
to Madrid, being little pleased with the stormy and veering statesmanship of
the day, he retired as much as possible from politics, and began to collect
materials for his life of Cervantes—an excellent and very complete work
published by the academy, with its edition of <i>Don Quijote</i>, in 1820. Honors
continued to cluster around the historian. Toward the close of 1823 he was
appointed director of the hydrographic department, and he became for many
years in fact, if not in name, the great and chief naval authority of Spain;
and this without prejudice to his literary activity. In 1825 appeared the
first two volumes of his Collection of Voyages; the third appeared in 1829;
the fourth and fifth in 1837; while the sixth and seventh were still unfinished
at the author's death. On the publication of the <i>Estatuto Real</i>, in 1834, he
received a place in the new peerage, and sat afterward as senator for his own
province, in almost every legislature. But his studious life and pacific character
were hardly destined to shine in a political career, nor was it for the interest
of science that they should. In the winter of 1844, in the seventy-ninth year of
his age, Navarrete died. The Academy issued a posthumous work of his in
1846, a dissertation on the history of the nautical and mathematical sciences in
Spain. A collection of his smaller works, <i>Coleccion de Opúsculos</i>, was begun in
1848 by his son. The two volumes which have already appeared consist mainly
of short biographies of Spanish navigators and literary men, previously scattered
in periodicals and in the transactions of the various academies and societies.
Navarrete was a man of learning and research, as clearly appears; inclined somewhat
to verbosity; tiresome to most readers, though pronounced <i>elegante y castizo</i>
by his contemporaries. Of the historical value of his works, however, there is
but one opinion. Humboldt speaks of his Collection of Voyages as 'one of
the most important monuments of modern times,' and calls him 'the most accurate
historian of the geographical discoveries on the New Continent.' The
Baron de Zach, M. de Berthelot, Prescott, Helps, Irving, and Stirling, have
all given him much consideration. Indeed, the friends of Navarrete cannot
complain that he has not been honored. Decorated with grand orders, member
in high place of many academies and societies, his lot was more fortunate
than is usual among literary men. The parts of Navarrete's collection which
bear most directly upon this history are: <i>Relacion de Diego de Porras</i>, i. 282-96;
<i>Carta que escribió D. Cristóbal Colon</i>, i. 296-313;
<i>Relacion hecha por Diego
Mendez</i>, i. 314-29;
<i>Cartas de Colon</i>, i. 330-52;
<i>Viages Menores</i>, iii. 1-74;
<i>Real
cédula por la cual, con referencia á lo capitulado con Diego de Nicuesa y Alonso
de Hojeda</i>, iii. 116-17;
<i>Noticias biográficas del capitan Alonso Hojeda</i>, iii. 163-76;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_200' href='#Page_200'>200</a></span>
and the <i>Establecimientos ó Primeras Poblaciones de los Españoles en el
Darien</i>, including instructions to Pedrarias, letters of Vasco Nuñez, memorial
of Rodrigo de Colmenares, and the relation of Pascual de Andagoya, iii.
337-459.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
Scarcely was Navarrete's <i>Coleccion de Viages</i> put to press, when Washington
Irving heard of it, and went to Madrid with the intention of translating
it into English. But he soon saw that with less labor he could accomplish a
work which would yield him greater returns. Navarrete, who had already
collected the material and prepared the way, was still disposed to lend the
genial American every assistance; it was necessary for him to make few original
investigations; so that under the circumstances the <i>Life of Columbus</i>
was by no means a difficult task for so ready a writer. Humboldt visited
Madrid before coming to America, but seems to have consulted no important
historical documents not in the possession of others. Prescott obtained from
the collections of Muñoz and Navarrete 8000 foolscap pages of copies, most
of which having any importance have since been printed by Icazbalceta, Alaman,
and others.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
Between the years 1837 and 1841 Henri Ternaux-Compans published at
Paris twenty volumes of <i>Voyages, relations, et mémoires originaux pour servir
à l'histoire de la découverte de l'Amérique</i>, containing, beside translations of
several rare and then unobtainable works, some seventy-five original documents,
several of them from the Muñoz collection, and others obtained from
the Spanish archives in some unexplained way, possibly not wholly disconnected
with the French campaign on the Peninsula. Among his translations
are documents relating to the conquest and settlement of Central America
and Mexico, the relations of Cabeza de Vaca and Ixtlilxochitl, Oviedo's History
of Nicaragua, Zurita's Report on New Spain, and Ixtlilxochitl's History
of the Chichimecs. Ternaux-Compans also published <i>Recueil de documents et
mémoires originaux sur l'histoire des possessions espagnoles dans l'Amérique</i>,
Paris, 1840; and <i>Bibliothèque américaine</i>, a catalogue of books on America
appearing prior to 1700.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
The project of printing original papers selected from national and family
archives was agitated in Spain by Campomanes, Jovellanos, Villamil, and
others, who collected and wrote much upon the subject. The scheme was
delayed by the political disruptions incident to the early part of the century,
by which the archives became badly scattered. In 1842, under the auspices
of the <i>Academia de la Historia</i>, was begun the publication, at Madrid, of a
<i>Coleccion de Documentos Inéditos para la Historia de España</i>, with the names
of Martin Fernandez Navarrete, Miguel Salvá, and Pedro Sainz de Baranda
on the title-page. Navarrete lived to see only the fifth volume; Salvá and
Baranda continued the publication to vol. xxiii., after which, Salvá edited
alone to vol. xxxii., when he was joined by the marquises of Pidal and of
Miraflores. After vol. xlvii., Pidal's name was dropped, and with vol. lvii.
Salvá and the Marqués de Fuente del Valle appeared as editors. In connection
with documents relating to the general history of Spain is here
printed a vast amount of matter about America, and the doings of Spaniards
in that quarter.

<p class="blockquot">
During the next score of years floods of light are let in upon the dark
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_201' href='#Page_201'>201</a></span>
recesses of hidden treasures, the spirit of unearthing which extends to
Mexico. I may mention incidentally Ramirez, who, in his <i>Proceso de Residencia
contra Alvarado</i> and <i>Nuño de Guzman</i>, gives some original Mexican
documents not elsewhere published. Alaman, at the close of his <i>Disertaciones</i>,
prints about forty original documents on the time of the Conquest, some of
them from the collection of Navarrete, and others from original sources, such
as the Hospital de Jesus in Mexico. The <i>Documentos para la Historia de
México</i>, Mexico, 1853-7, in 21 volumes, was made chiefly from Mexican
sources, and is specially valuable for north-west Mexico. Icazbalceta's
collection includes fifty-three documents, with few exceptions <i>inéditos</i>, the
existence of several of which, such as a letter of Cortés, and the relation of
Tapia on the Conquest, was then unknown. Most of them were obtained
through Gonzalez de Vera, of Madrid; only two or three were found in Mexico.
Thus far Icazbalceta's collection refers exclusively to the sixteenth
century. Brasseur de Bourbourg, for his <i>Histoire des Nations Civilisées du
Mexique</i>, Paris, 1857-9, one volume of which is devoted to a history of the
Conquest from an Indian stand-point, seems to have relied on his Nahua manuscripts,
the standard histories, and a few Spanish manuscripts. Although
much thus far had been done, it seemed little to the savans of Spain in comparison
with what yet might be accomplished. And it was with this feeling
that the government authorized the printing of any documents in the <i>Real
Archivo de Indias</i> affecting the history of America down to the end of the seventeenth
century. The publication of this new series of papers was begun
at Madrid in 1864 under title of <i>Coleccion de Documentos Inéditos relativos al
Descubrimiento, Conquista y Colonizacion de las posesiones Españolas en América
y Oceanía, sacados, en su mayor parte, del Real Archivo de Indias</i>. Joaquin
F. Pacheco, Francisco de Cárdenas, and Luis Torres de Mendoza were editors
at the first. After vol. iii. the first two names were dropped, and after vol.
xii. the third, the work being thenceforth continued, <i>competentemente autorizada</i>.
By this publication alone were placed within easy reach of all the
world hundreds of the richest treasures of the Archives of the Indies, twenty
for every one that the writer of thirty years ago could reach.

<div class="sidenote">FOURTH VOYAGE OF THE ADMIRAL.</div>

<p>
Since his last return to Spain, Columbus had rested
at Granada under the smiles of the sovereigns, who
readily promised him all that he might wish, while
resolved to grant nothing which could interfere with
their absolute domination of the new lands that he
had found for them. When tired of begging the
restoration of his rights he urged their Majesties'
assistance in seizing the holy sepulchre, that his vow
might be fulfilled, and his mind at rest. After profound
study and elaborate preparation he presented
the case to them in a manuscript volume of prophecies
and portents intermingled with poetry. Failing in
winning them to this scheme, he promised, if ships
were provided him, to undertake new discoveries.
Partly because they would know more of their New
World possessions, and partly to rid themselves of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_203' href='#Page_203'>203</a></span>
uncomfortable importunities, the sovereigns assented
to this proposal, meanwhile intimating that after two
years had been allowed in which to quiet Española,
the admiral should have his own again, but as clearly
indicating to others that he should not.
</p>

<p>
Four vessels, ranging in burden from fifty to seventy
tons, were then made ready, the <i>Capitana</i>, the
<i>Santiago de Polos</i>, the <i>Gallego</i>, and the <i>Vizcaino</i>,
commanded respectively by Diego Tristan, Francisco
de Porras, Pedro de Terreros, and Bartolomé de
Fresco, and embarked at Cádiz the 9th of May,
1502. With the expedition sailed Diego de Porras
as chief clerk and notary, and Juan Sanchez as chief
pilot; one hundred and forty men and boys constituted
the company. The admiral was accompanied
by his brother Bartolomé, the adelantado,<a id='FA_IV-1' href='#FN_IV-1' class='fnanchor'>[IV-1]</a> and by
his son Fernando,<a id='FA_IV-2' href='#FN_IV-2' class='fnanchor'>[IV-2]</a> then thirteen years of age. The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_204' href='#Page_204'>204</a></span>
sail across the ocean was prosperous, with favorable
winds and nothing to augur the approaching misfortunes
until the ships arrived off Santo Domingo
on the 29th of June.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">FATE OF BOBADILLA.</div>

<p>
During the past two years matters had not improved
at Española. It seems that others could
govern badly as well as the admiral. Indeed, the
kings of Spain, most of them meaning well by their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_205' href='#Page_205'>205</a></span>
New World subjects, were too often unfortunate in
their choice of agents. Until recently Bobadilla had
held sway, the sovereigns being apparently in no
haste to displace him; from which course it was evident
either that they had not been properly informed
of his conduct, or they approved of it. Perhaps
it was true that a knave was better for the place
than an honest man. A successor, however, had at
length arrived in the person of Nicolás de Ovando,
and the superb fleet which had brought him, and was
to carry back the displaced governor to Spain, now
rode at anchor in the harbor.
</p>

<p>
In following that contriving policy which others
beside princes sometimes regard as necessary when
straightforwardness were better, it had been deemed
expedient that Columbus should not on this expedition
touch at Española, lest his presence engender
fresh broils on the island. And the admiral
appeared to entertain no intention of breaking the
royal commands, until he found, on reaching the Indies,
that one of his vessels was unfit for service; or
else he pretended that it was so in order to look in
on his late government. But whether in actual or
feigned distress, when the admiral sent the 29th of
June to ask of Ovando permission to exchange a leaky
caravel, or at least to shelter the vessels from an
impending storm, his messenger Terreros returned
with a refusal.
</p>

<p>
It was certainly an anomalous position in which the
great discoverer found himself, vainly knocking at the
door of a possession which he had so lately given to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_206' href='#Page_206'>206</a></span>
Spain, and he not convicted, nay, scarcely accused
of any crime. Columbus sent again and warned
the governor of approaching bad weather. Ovando
would not heed him. The gubernatorial fleet sailed;
but only to face a hurricane which soon strewed
the shores of Española with its fragments. Current
biographies here read like a moral story. On the
wrecked vessels were Bobadilla, Roldan, and other
inveterate enemies of the admiral, who with a huge
mass of ill-gotten treasure were buried beneath the
waves. On a little caravel which survived the tempest
was the good Bastidas with his property; and on
another, which likewise reached Spain in safety, were
four thousand <i>pesos de oro</i> belonging to Columbus.
Furthermore the admiral sheltered his vessels, and
so received no injury from the storm. From all
which, grave deductions were severally made—by
Columbus, that the Almighty had preserved him;
by his enemies, that he had employed witchcraft to
save himself and property; by others, of a luckless
order which providence refuses to recognize, that
the admiral and adelantado were good seamen. After
certain ship repairs, made without difficulty in a little
port near Santo Domingo, on the 14th of July
Columbus sailed westward on his explorations.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">EARLY CARTOGRAPHY.</div>

<p>
It must be remembered that at this time, and
for several years afterward, the Spaniards did not
know where they were. They supposed the earth
smaller than it is, and that they were on the barbarous
outposts of India,<a id='FA_IV-3' href='#FN_IV-3' class='fnanchor'>[IV-3]</a> whose interior was civilized
and wealthy; and it was the present object of the
admiral to find some strait or passage between this
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_207' href='#Page_207'>207</a></span>
border-land and the detached southern regions about
Paria, on which he might sail to these rich inner
realms, still coasting Asia south-westward.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">GUANAJA ISLAND.</div>

<p>
A storm greeted him, followed by a calm, during
which he was carried first southward by Jamaica,
then northward past the western end of Cuba; after
which, the wind freshening, he continued his course,
and on the 30th of July came to a small elevated
island, called by the natives Guanaja<a id='FA_IV-4' href='#FN_IV-4' class='fnanchor'>[IV-4]</a>, to which, from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_208' href='#Page_208'>208</a></span>
the trees that covered it, he gave the name Isla de
Pinos. On going ashore, the adelantado found the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_209' href='#Page_209'>209</a></span>
island inhabited by people like those of Española and
Cuba, except that they seemed more intelligent and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_210' href='#Page_210'>210</a></span>
knew more of the useful arts. Presently a large
canoe appeared coming from the direction of Yucatan.
It measured eight feet in its greatest width,
and was rowed by twenty-five men. In the middle,
under a palm-leaf awning, sat a <i>cacique</i>,<a id='FA_IV-5' href='#FN_IV-5' class='fnanchor'>[IV-5]</a> or chief, who
manifested neither surprise nor fear on being brought
into the presence of the admiral. He signified to the
Spaniards as best he was able the extent and power
of Mexico, and displayed utensils of copper, stone,
and wood, earthen-ware, and cotton cloth brought
thence. Gold was plentiful there, he also said; but
the imagination of the admiral had mapped his strait
somewhere southward; so Mexico was kept for Cortés.
</p>

<p>
There was on the island an ancient aboriginal of
scientific attainments sufficient to enable him to draw
for the Spaniards a chart of the mainland coast, and
tell them much of the country. Him they took on
board, and after dismissing the cacique with presents,
crossed to the continent, and anchored near a point
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_211' href='#Page_211'>211</a></span>
which Columbus called Punta de Caxinas,<a id='FA_IV-6' href='#FN_IV-6' class='fnanchor'>[IV-6]</a> from the
native name of a certain fruit abounding thereabout.
Here the Spaniards landed on the 14th of August,
and celebrated mass; then proceeding eastward some
fifteen leagues to the mouth of a river,<a id='FA_IV-7' href='#FN_IV-7' class='fnanchor'>[IV-7]</a> they again
landed on the 17th, and took formal possession for
Spain. About a hundred painted savages displayed
themselves, finer specimens than any on the islands,
some naked, and others partially covered with white
or colored cotton. They were friendly, and presented
fruit and vegetables, fish, fowl, and maize. So conspicuously
distended were the ears of the natives at
one place that the name Costa de la Oreja was given
to that vicinity.<a id='FA_IV-8' href='#FN_IV-8' class='fnanchor'>[IV-8]</a>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">DISCOVERY OF HONDURAS.</div>

<p>
Proceeding, the discoverers encountered a succession
of gales which continued more than forty days,
and having weathered them safely they were so
delighted that in sailing round the point of their
deliverance they thanked God, and called it Cape
Gracias á Dios.<a id='FA_IV-9' href='#FN_IV-9' class='fnanchor'>[IV-9]</a> All this time Columbus suffered
severely. Indeed, he was now but little better than
a wreck in body and mind. On the after part of the
deck his bed was placed, and there he lay overwhelmed
with pain and melancholy, lost in endless
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_212' href='#Page_212'>212</a></span>
mazes of speculation. Now and then he would rouse
himself to translate his visions, or to direct the management
of the ship, for though half his senses should
leave him, he was still a sailor from instinct; but had
it not been for the faithful energy of the adelantado,
the voyage might as well never have been undertaken.
</p>

<p>
The mariners had now entered a smooth sea; with
a favorable wind they passed rapidly down the Mosquito
Coast, giving the name Limonares to a cluster
of islands on which grew something like lemons or
limes, and on the 16th of September anchored at
the mouth of a large river. Boats were sent ashore
for water, and in returning one was upset and the
whole crew were drowned; from which melancholy
occurrence the stream was named Rio del Desastre.<a id='FA_IV-10' href='#FN_IV-10' class='fnanchor'>[IV-10]</a>
Continuing, the 25th found the Spaniards off the
Rio San Juan de Nicaragua, where, to escape a
storm, they ran in behind an island, the native name
of which was Quiriviri,<a id='FA_IV-11' href='#FN_IV-11' class='fnanchor'>[IV-11]</a> but which from its verdant
beauty Columbus called La Huerta, The Garden.
There they rested several days, and found sweet speculation,
easily inducing the savages to tell them such
things as they should most delight to hear. Indeed,
all along the coast had vague information been given,
by signs ill interpreted, of a remarkable country called
Ciguare, nine days' journey westward beyond the
mountains. The people there were like the Spaniards,
clothed, and armed with steel weapons, with
horses and great ships. The women wore bands of
coral and strings of pearls, and the commonest utensils
were of gold. Ten days' journey from Ciguare
must lie the river Ganges; and best of all, there was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_213' href='#Page_213'>213</a></span>
a passage thither by sea; all the Spaniards had to do
was to keep right on; they could not miss the way.
The Europeans gave full credit to these assertions.
Thus from the beginning mankind have been directed,
and oftentimes to the grandest discoveries, by mingled
accident and ignorance, and wise men like Columbus
have believed these supremely silly stories because
it pleased them to do so. These savages may have
had rumors of Mexico or Peru on which to build
their brilliant fictions; their statements were fictions
none the less.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">SORCERIES, SAVAGE AND CIVILIZED.</div>

<p>
And indeed as they came together there for the
first time, the white men and the red, it is often
difficult to tell on which side was the greater simplicity
and credulity. The folly of the Spaniard was
moulded into firmer consistence, was less inept and
vapory than the folly of the Americans, and that was
about all. For instance, at the village of Cariay,<a id='FA_IV-12' href='#FN_IV-12' class='fnanchor'>[IV-12]</a>
just opposite on the main-land, Columbus thought
to raise the Spaniards in the estimation of the savages
by declining to take the <i>guanin</i>, an inferior kind of
gold which they presented; whereupon for the same
reason, and in retaliation, the natives refused European
trinkets. When the adelantado, seated on a
knoll with the notary by his side, sought to transfix
some of the wild knowledge of those parts, the natives
fled terrorstruck, supposing some magic spell
was being cast upon them by the pens, ink, and
paper so solemnly drawn forth by the scribe. Presently
with great caution they returned, and with
exorcising gesticulations burned and scattered in the
air an odorous powder. On the other hand, with
equally enlightened common sense, the Christians,
unable to fathom the incantations of savagism, fancied
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_214' href='#Page_214'>214</a></span>
these heathen sorcerers bringing from the shades of
their wilderness wrathful demons to hurl upon their
adversaries; and ever after on the voyage all the
ills that befell the Spaniards were attributed to the
enchantments of the people of Cariay.<a id='FA_IV-13' href='#FN_IV-13' class='fnanchor'>[IV-13]</a> At another
port called Huiva, Columbus found the huts of the
natives built in trees, which he attributed to fear of
griffins. After a short excursion into the interior
the adelantado returned to the ships. Near Cape
Gracias á Dios the old man of Guanaja had been
liberated with presents, as no longer of use; now,
seven natives were seized and made to divulge what
they knew of the country, two of them being retained
as guides.
</p>

<p>
Sailing from Cariay the 5th of October, the second
day they came to the Laguna de Chiriquí, the
country thereabout being called by the natives Cerebaro.<a id='FA_IV-14' href='#FN_IV-14' class='fnanchor'>[IV-14]</a>
If some distance back Columbus had found
The Garden, here was a pluralized paradise. The
wonder was how nature contrived such glories.
Round the entrance clustered islands whose outspread
foliage brushed the venturesome sails that
threaded the deep narrow channels. Celestial beauty
irradiated the land, and a celestial brightness overspread
the sea. But a small additional rent was
necessary in the ragged imagination of the admiral
to fancy himself already translated. The part of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_215' href='#Page_215'>215</a></span>
laguna explored by this expedition was the north-western,
known to-day as the Bahía del Almirante;
the southern part was called by the natives Aburema.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">GATHERING GOLD.</div>

<p>
Hanging from the necks of the natives was pure
gold in plates, now first found since touching these
shores, but the owners were content to keep it.
Further on, anywhere but here, they said, was plenty
of gold, notably at a place called Veragua, twenty-five
leagues distant, where these much-admired plates of
gold were fabricated. Hastening forward, the Spaniards
arrived, on the 18th, at a river twelve leagues
to the eastward of Cerebaro, called by Fernando
Colon, Guaiga, and by Porras, Guyga, where the
savages attempted at first to drive them away by
splashing water, brandishing wooden swords, beating
drums, and sounding conchs; which demonstration
being over they quietly traded sixteen of their gold-plates,
valued at one hundred and fifty ducats, for
three hawk-bells. The following day the Spaniards
were met in like manner by other savages whom a
shot sent scampering; after which they returned and
traded dutifully.
</p>

<p>
After this the discoverers touched at the provinces
of Catibá and Cobrabá, where they saw the
ruins of a wall built of stone and lime, which excited
in them anticipations of a near approach to civilization;
but as they neared the rich river the wind
freshened and carried them past, without however
preventing a glimpse of five towns, one of which the
guides assured them was Veragua.<a id='FA_IV-15' href='#FN_IV-15' class='fnanchor'>[IV-15]</a> In the next
province, Cubigá, terminated the gold region, so they
were told. Some were eager to go back to Veragua
and gather gold, but anxious to find his strait
Columbus put them off, saying he would return anon.
</p>

<p>
Fancy the old admiral groping in the darkness, the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_216' href='#Page_216'>216</a></span>
world, the universe clear enough to him as mapped
in his own mind, but unhappily not fitting the substantial
facts. Instinctively he seems to hover about
this the narrowest part of the continent, his ship's
prow now pointed directly toward Spain, with India
so far away, and the vast water intervening, and the
small but mighty strip of land that makes his mental
map of no avail. Thus since the world began millions
have mapped eternity, and still do map it, the heavenly
powers meanwhile laughing at the miserable work
men make of it.
</p>

<p>
Thus vainly searching, on the 2d of November
Columbus finds his ships at anchor in a beautiful
and commodious harbor entered between two islands.
On every side are fields of maize, and orchards of fruit,
and groves of palm; for the people dwell in houses
and cultivate the ground. There he remains seven
days, waiting the cessation of a storm; and he calls
the place Puerto Bello, also written Portobello, which
name it has ever since retained. Venturing forth on
the 9th, he makes eastward eight leagues, but is
driven back, and takes refuge behind some islands
in a small harbor, which he calls Puerto de Bastimentos,<a id='FA_IV-16' href='#FN_IV-16' class='fnanchor'>[IV-16]</a>
from the abundance of provisions brought
them there. After repairing the ships, now badly
worm-eaten, he again on the 23d attempts an advance
eastward, but is speedily driven into a cove, which he
names El Retrete, some calling it Puerto de Escribanos,
and which is so small as barely to admit the
ships, and so deep that bottom cannot be touched.<a id='FA_IV-17' href='#FN_IV-17' class='fnanchor'>[IV-17]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_217' href='#Page_217'>217</a></span>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">END OF THE ADMIRAL'S DISCOVERIES.</div>

<p>
And now the mariners show signs of discontent;
with gold so near they are not Spaniards else. And
the great discoverer, the admiral of the ocean sea,
must he bury in this little crevice of a barbarous
shore his mighty hopes? Bastidas was here,<a id='FA_IV-18' href='#FN_IV-18' class='fnanchor'>[IV-18]</a> although
it is not certain how well informed the admiral
is of the fact, whether he had notice from Bastidas
at Santo Domingo as to the termination of his voyage,
or whether the natives here had told him; in
any event, there cannot be now in the admiral's
mind much doubt that the coast is practically discovered
from Trinidad to Guanaja, and that between
these two islands is a shore-line of continent unbroken
by any strait. Yes, as well unbrace here as elsewhere;
and gold-hunting is not a bad occupation for an old
man after his life's work is done.
</p>

<p>
Turning then toward Veragua for solace, the Spaniards
sailed from El Retrete the 5th of December.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_218' href='#Page_218'>218</a></span>
But with this change the fickle wind had likewise
changed its course; wherever they went were storms
and buffetings, until Columbus pronounced upon that
shore the name La Costa de los Contrastes. Where
now was the balmy breath of perfumed isles, the
sparkling sun dancing beneath the wanton waters?
Demonized. Gale followed gale in quick succession;
winds contending, veering; now the mariners were
hurried on toward their destination, only to be
driven back to their starting-point. The stubborn
waves struck the crazy barks with such menacing
force as to send the terror-stricken sailors to their
knees in confession, and prayer for deliverance. For
nine days the sea was white with angry foam; the sky
blazed with electric fires; the men fell sick; provisions
spoiled. Long, lank, muscular sharks, weatherwise
monsters, followed the ships expectantly, until the
hunger-smitten crews eyed them ominously in return,
until these creatures that had come to eat were
caught and eaten by these other creatures. All this
time down poured the rain in torrents and nearly
submerged the ships. In the midst of these cataclysmal
horrors a water-spout was seen approaching,
"which," Fernando Colon is sure, "if they had not
dissolved by reciting the gospel of St John, would
certainly have sunk whatever it had fallen upon."
Twenty-nine days were occupied in making as many
leagues to the westward. Once the ships parted company
for three days; twice they ran into Portobello,
and twice they took refuge at other places on the
coast.
</p>

<p>
At length, with thanksgiving, January 6, 1503,
they came to anchor at the mouth of a river, the
native name of which was Yebra; but Columbus, in
honor of the day, Epiphany, called it Santa María
de Belen.<a id='FA_IV-19' href='#FN_IV-19' class='fnanchor'>[IV-19]</a> One league to the westward was the
river Veragua. The admiral ordered both streams
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_219' href='#Page_219'>219</a></span>
to be sounded. The Veragua was found too shallow
for the ships. At the mouth of the Belen was a bar,
which however could be crossed at high water;
above the bar the depth was four fathoms. On the
bank of the Belen stood a village, whose inhabitants
at first opposed the landing of the Spaniards; but
being persuaded by the interpreter, they at length
yielded. They were a well-developed, muscular people,
rather above medium stature, intelligent, and
exceptionally shrewd; in fact, in point of native
ability they were in no wise inferior to the Spaniards.
When questioned concerning their country, they answered
guardedly; when asked about their gold mines,
they replied evasively. First, it was from some far-off
mysterious mountain the metal came; then the river
Veragua was made to yield it all; there was none at
all about Belen, nor within their territory, in fact.
Finally they took a few trinkets, and gave the intruders
twenty plates of gold, thinking to be rid of them.
Within a day or two the vessels were taken over the
bar, and on the 9th two of them ascended the river a
short distance. The natives made the best of it, and
brought fish and gold.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE QUIBIAN.</div>

<p>
With an armed force the adelantado sets out in
boats to explore the Veragua. He has not proceeded
far when he is met by a fleet of canoes, in one of
which sits the <i>quibian</i>,<a id='FA_IV-20' href='#FN_IV-20' class='fnanchor'>[IV-20]</a> the king of all that country,
having under him many subordinate chiefs. He is
tall, well-modelled, and compactly built, with restless,
searching eyes, but otherwise expressionless features,
taciturn and dignified, and, for a savage, of exceptionally
bland demeanor. We shall find him as politic as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_220' href='#Page_220'>220</a></span>
he is powerful; and as for his wealth, unfortunately
for him, his domain includes the richest gold mines
of that rich coast. On the whole, the quibian is as
fine a specimen of his race as the adelantado is of his.
And thus they are fairly met, the men of Europe
and the men of North America; and as in the gladiatorial
combat, which opens with a smiling salutation,
this four-century life-struggle begins with friendly
greetings. Pity it is, they are outwardly not more
evenly matched; pity it is that the European with his
superior civilization, his saltpetre, and blood-hounds,
his steel weapons, and strange diseases, should be
allowed to do his robbery so easily! But ravenous
beasts and bloody bipeds are so made that they do not
hesitate to take advantage of the helpless; it is only
civilized man, however, that calls his butcherings by
pleasant names, such as progress, piety, and makes
his religion and his law conform to his heart's unjust
desires.
</p>

<p>
As the champions approach each other, we see
about them both an air of determination and command;
and while extremely cordial, we see on either
side that courtesy common to those who fear while
they suspect. With princely grace the red man takes
from his naked body some massive golden ornaments
and presents them to the white man; the adelantado,
not to be outdone in generosity by a savage, with
equal dignity and solemnity presents the red man a
handful of valueless baubles. The ceremony over,
with mutual assurances of friendship the chieftains
retire. Next day the quibian visits the admiral in
his ship. Neither has much to say; presents are
exchanged, and the savage returns to his people.
</p>

<p>
While the ships of the Spaniards lay by the bank
in fancied security, on the 24th of January the storm-demon,
as if enraged at the escape of its victims from
the fury of the sea, rushed to the mountains, and
opening the windows of heaven, let down a deluge on
the land. The rushing torrents swept everything before
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_221' href='#Page_221'>221</a></span>
them. The vessels were torn from their moorings
and carried down the river, only to be met at the
mouth by the incoming breakers from the sea. And
thus to their imminent peril they were tossed for
several days by the contending waters.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">BARTOLOMÉ PENETRATES THE INTERIOR.</div>

<p>
The storm abating, and the ships made secure, the
adelantado again started in search of the gold-fields.
With sixty-eight men he ascended the Veragua to
the village of the quibian, whose house was situated
on a hill round which were scattered the dwellings
of his people. The chieftain with a large retinue,
unarmed in token of peace, welcomed the visitors at
the landing. Guides were readily furnished at the
adelantado's request; so leaving part of his company
to guard the boats, with the remainder he set out on
foot for the base of the mountain, distant six leagues,
which he reached the following day. For many
miles he found the soil richly impregnated with gold,
and returned elated, as visions of populous cities and
unbounded wealth floated through his brain. Which
seeing, the quibian grimly smiled that they should
deem their work already done, himself subdued, the
land their own; and he smiled to think how he had
sent them round and away from his own rich mines
to the poorer and more distant fields of Urirá, his
ancient enemy. Then the adelantado explored westward,
and came to the town and river<a id='FA_IV-21' href='#FN_IV-21' class='fnanchor'>[IV-21]</a> of this Urirá,
and to the towns of Dururi, Cobrabá, and Catibá,
where he obtained gold and provisions.
</p>

<p class="p2">
There were here fifty leagues of coast, from Cerebaro
to Veragua, called by the Spaniards the <i>tierra
de rescate</i>, or land of trade, meaning trade in gold,
that being the only thing worth trading for in an
expedition of this kind. This seaboard was heavily
wooded, and uninhabited except along the rivers,
for three leagues inland. And all things seeming so
favorable, Columbus thought he would plant a colony
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_222' href='#Page_222'>222</a></span>
here, leave eighty men and one of the vessels in
charge of the adelantado, and with the remainder
return to Spain, report the results of his discovery,
and obtain reinforcements. In a word, if not restrained
by some Ferdinand, or Fonseca, or other hateful friend,
he would repeat with fresh enthusiasm his former
errors which had so nearly wrought his ruin. But
his usual ill-luck came to the rescue. The quibian did
not view with favor the preparations which he saw
the Spaniards making for a permanent residence on
his lands, and he determined it should not be. But
how could he prevent it? For he was well aware
of the advantages these strangers possessed in open
warfare. Yet there were several ways open to him;
if he did not wish to attack them with an overwhelming
force he could devastate the country around,
withdraw his people, and leave the Spaniards to die,
meanwhile cutting off such stragglers and foraging
parties as he could easily handle. And this he did,
beginning operations by summoning the neighboring
tribes, ostensibly for the purpose of organizing an
expedition against Urirá, and Cobrabá.
</p>

<p>
The suspicions of the Spaniards were aroused.
Diego Mendez, <i>escudero</i>, esquire, or shield-bearer
of the ship <i>Santiago</i>,<a id='FA_IV-22' href='#FN_IV-22' class='fnanchor'>[IV-22]</a> a sharp, bold, and somewhat
boastful man, but courageous beyond the comprehension
of fear, asked and obtained permission to
investigate the matter. Entering the Veragua in an
armed boat he found encamped below the quibian's
village about a thousand painted warriors. Assuming
an air of unconcern Mendez landed and strolled
leisurely among the savages. Remarking on their
proposed expedition he offered to join them; but his
services were rejected, and his presence was manifestly
distasteful to them. He returned and reported
that the savages were preparing to attack the Spaniards.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_223' href='#Page_223'>223</a></span>
Yet to satisfy some who doubted, Mendez
went again, this time taking with him one companion,
Rodrigo de Escobar, intending plainly to demand of
the quibian his purpose. A host of frowning savages
greeted the visitors, who asked to see the quibian.
They were informed that he was lying ill from the
effects of a wound received in battle. "For that
very purpose," replied the ready Mendez, "I a surgeon
am come to heal him." But the Spaniards
could not gain audience of the chief, and they returned
more than ever convinced of his bloody intention
toward them.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">CAPTURE OF THE QUIBIAN.</div>

<p>
What was to be done? The admiral could not
depart while hostilities were pending, nor could the
Spaniards delay their operations until it should please
the savages to attack them. The adelantado determined
to force an issue. With seventy-five men, on
the morning of the 30th of March, he ascended the
Veragua, and landed unobserved near the quibian's
village. Hiding his men, he advanced, first with
four attendants, then alone, until after some difficulty
he gained admission to the quibian's presence.
What Bartolomé was now attempting was the regular
game, afterward played for higher stakes, but now
being pretty generally practised in the New World;
namely, to capture the chief and hold him hostage
for the good behavior of his people. It was at the
door in front of the quibian's dwelling that this
interview took place. The savage suspected nothing.
The very boldness of the scheme, so foreign
to aboriginal warfare, tended to allay apprehension.
Within were fifty of his household, and at easy
call five hundred warriors; what had the quibian
to fear? The two chiefs sat and talked, first on
general subjects; then the adelantado enquired concernedly
about his host's illness, examined the wound
tenderly, passed his hands over the disabled limb
while proposing remedies. Suddenly the savage felt
the grasp of the Spaniard tighten upon him, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_224' href='#Page_224'>224</a></span>
before his suspicions were fairly aroused his arms
were pinioned behind him. Mendez, who had been
watching, fired his arquebuse, and the concealed
Spaniards rushed forward and surrounded the house.
The quibian struggled, but weakened by sickness he
was easily held in the iron grasp of the adelantado,
until by the aid of the other Spaniards he was made
powerless. So adroitly was the feat performed, that
before the presence of the Spaniards was generally
known among the natives, their chief and all his
family were captive, and on the way to the boats.
The savages lifted up the usual lamentations, and
offered enormous ransom; but it had been determined
beforehand that the chief personages of the
nation should be sent to Spain; for in such procedure,
the admiral thought, lay the greater security of his
plans.
</p>

<p>
At this juncture in the narrative historians, even
modern writers of fair intelligence, gravely discuss
the probabilities of guilt in the quibian's supposed
treachery, some holding with Diego de Porras that
the natives did not meditate attack; as if they had
not the right to defend their country, their wives and
little ones, from the ravages of the invader by any
means within their power.
</p>

<p>
Passing conventional twaddle—for if the quibian
was not guilty he ought in honor to have been—it
is very certain that this action on the part of the
Spaniards was the cause of many woes, and of their
final overthrow in these parts.<a id='FA_IV-23' href='#FN_IV-23' class='fnanchor'>[IV-23]</a> In any event it was
now of the highest importance to secure the quibian.
The whole adventure on this coast depended upon it;
therefore the adelantado hastened to send his captives
on board the ships. Desirous of instituting other
proceedings for the pacification of that section before
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_225' href='#Page_225'>225</a></span>
returning, the adelantado looked about him for a
reliable person to whom he might entrust his weighty
charge. Present was Juan Sanchez, chief pilot, an
honest sailor, not wholly indifferent to military honors,
who earnestly offered service and was accepted. The
quibian, tied hand and foot, was firmly bound to his
seat in the boat; and superfluous as might appear any
admonition, the adelantado charged Juan Sanchez to
look well to his prisoner. "Pluck out my beard hair
by hair if he escape me," was the vaunting reply of
the pilot as he shoved his boat from the bank and
started down the river.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">JUAN SANCHEZ OUTWITTED.</div>

<p>
But alas for the overweening confidence of a Peter
or a Juan Sanchez! Fighting the elements at sea is
a different thing from fighting Indians on land. Quite
a different order of tactics is required; and the sailor's
life is not the school in which to study the wiles of
Indian strategy. In the one place the sailor is not
more superior than is the savage in the other. The
quibian, outwardly calm, inwardly is fiercely excited;
and like the wild beast when hotly pursued, his instincts
quicken with the occasion. He and his loved
ones are prisoners, treacherously entrapped by a
strange species of the human kind in return for fair
words and generous hospitality. Their probable fate
possesses all the horrors of uncertainty. Swiftly with
the swift boat runs the time away; something must
be done or all is lost. Narrowly, but cautiously,
the chief surveys his keeper. It is pleasant to look
upon the homely face of honest Juan Sanchez; not a
lineament there but shines with God's best message
to man, and in language which even dumb intelligence
may read. Stern duty is largely diluted with humanity,
integrity with charming simplicity; from which
the wily quibian takes his cue, and thenceforth is
master of the situation. With quiet dignity and
cheerful resignation he sits among his people, hushing
their lamentations and chiding their complaints. By
words and little acts of consideration he lightens the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_226' href='#Page_226'>226</a></span>
labors of the boatmen, and studies for himself and
people to give no unnecessary trouble. These conciliatory
measures are not lost on the warm-hearted
sailor, whose regard for his royal captive rises every
moment. He is pronounced by all a well-mannered
savage, a most courteous savage. And now the quibian
modestly complains of the cords so tightly drawn
by the too zealous Mendez. They do indeed cut into
the flesh, and constrain him to a most uncomfortable
position. And he such a gentleman-savage! Juan
Sanchez is not the man to sit there and see a fellow-creature
unnecessarily suffer; he cannot do it. The
thongs which lacerate the prisoner's wrists are loosened,
the cord which binds him to the seat is untied;
but for security—for above all this great chief must
be kept secure—one end of it the ever-watchful pilot
twists round his hand. Night comes on. It is very
dark, but the captives are quiet, and the boat glides
noiselessly down the stream. Suddenly the light craft
sways; a plunge is heard; the pilot feels his hand
violently wrenched; he must loosen his hold or be
drawn into the water. It is all as the flash of a pistol
in point of time; the quibian's seat is empty; and
honest Juan Sanchez is obliged to present his hanging
front before his comrades, a Spaniard outwitted by a
savage!
</p>

<p class="p2">
After scouring the country in several directions,
the adelantado returned to the ships, bringing gold-plates,
wristlets, and anklets to the value of three
hundred ducats, which were divided, after deducting
the king's fifth. Among the spoils taken from
the quibian were two golden coronets, one of which
was presented to Bartolomé by the admiral. Notwithstanding
the escape of the chief, who, after all,
was probably drowned, Columbus proceeded to execute
his plans. There were the king's household and
his chief men safely on board, and these should be
sufficient to guarantee the tranquillity of the nations.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_227' href='#Page_227'>227</a></span>
So the arrangements for the comfort and security of
the colony during the contemplated absence of the
admiral were hastened to completion. The three
vessels, after discharging part of their cargoes, were
carried by the newly swollen stream over the bar, and
reloaded. There they lay at anchor waiting a favorable
wind.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE COUNTRY ROUSED.</div>

<p>
All this time, however, the Spaniards were reckoning
without their host. The quibian was not dead.
In spite of his bonds, he had made good his escape.
After his bold plunge, finding himself free from the
boat, he had extricated his wrists from the loosened
cords, swam beneath the water to the bank, and had
set out for his village, resolving vengeance. And
now, hastily arming a thousand warriors, he attacked
the Spaniards under cover of the dense vegetation,
killing one and wounding eight, but was soon repulsed
with heavy loss. Shortly afterward Diego Tristan,
coming ashore from one of the vessels with eleven
men, recklessly ascended the river a league for wood
and water. All but one were killed.<a id='FA_IV-24' href='#FN_IV-24' class='fnanchor'>[IV-24]</a>
</p>

<p class="p2">
The aspect of affairs was serious. It was now evident
that no fear of what might befall his imprisoned
household would deter the quibian from his bloody
purpose. Alive or dead might be his brothers, wives,
and children, he would rid his country of these perfidious
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_228' href='#Page_228'>228</a></span>
strangers. To this end he secured the coöperation
of the neighboring chieftains, and filled the
forest with his warriors. Stealthily they lurked in the
vicinity of the settlement, and watched every pathway,
ready to cut off any who should venture abroad.
Nowhere on the Islands had the Spaniards met such
stubborn opposition, and serious misgivings filled their
minds. Their own probable doom they saw foreshadowed
in the mutilated bodies of Tristan and his
men, which came floating past them down the stream,
attended by ravenous fishes; and the requiems sung
by quarrelling vultures over the remains when afterward
they were thrown back by the waves upon the
beach, tended in no wise to lessen their dismal forebodings.
To heighten their misfortunes, a furious
storm arose, which cut off all communication between
the settlement and the ships. The adelantado endeavored
in vain to quiet the fears of his people,
who emboldened by despair would have seized the
remaining caravel and put to sea had the weather
permitted. Yet closer pressed upon them the enraged
quibian, until dislodged they retreated to the river
bank, before their caravel, and threw up earthworks,
which they capped with the ship's boat, and behind
which they planted their guns, and so kept the savages
at bay.
</p>

<p>
On shipboard matters were no better. The continued
absence of Tristan and his crew caused the
admiral great anxiety. In such a heavy sea it was
unsafe to remain near the shore; the parting of a
cable would doom the clumsy craft to swift destruction.
And as if this were not enough, the spirit
of the quibian broke out among his encaged family.
Preferring death to captivity they plotted escape.
During the night the prisoners were confined in the
forecastle, and on the covering slept a guard of soldiers.
Collecting one night such articles as were
within reach, stones used as ballast, boxes, and provision
casks, they piled them up under the hatchway
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_229' href='#Page_229'>229</a></span>
cover. Toward morning, when the guards were sleeping
soundly, as many of the captives as were able
mounted the heap, and placing their shoulders to the
covering, by quick concerted action burst it open,
throwing the sleeping sentinels in every direction,
and springing out leaped into the sea. Those whose
escape was prevented were found next morning dead,
some hanging to the roof and sides of their prison,
some strangled by means of strings round the neck
drawn tight with the foot.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SETTLEMENT ABANDONED.</div>

<p>
It was now of the utmost importance to communicate
with the shore, as the admiral was convinced
that the situation of the colonists was becoming perilous
in the extreme. At least, all hope of settlement
in that quarter must for the present be abandoned.
The fate of the captives, when once it was known,
would move the very rocks to revenge. But no boat
could live in the surf intervening. Then stepped forward
Pedro Ledesma, a Sevillian pilot, and offered if
rowed to the breakers to attempt to gain the shore
by swimming. The thing was done. Scarcely had
Ledesma picked himself up from the spot where the
waves threw him when he was surrounded by his forlorn
countrymen, who informed him of the fate of
Tristan, and of their determination to quit that accursed
coast at any hazard. Ledesma returned and
told the admiral, upon whose mind thereupon gloom
settled in yet denser shades. Unrighteously deprived
of his command at Santo Domingo, he had nourished
the hope that this last and most important of his discoveries
might prove the base of better fortune than
was possible on the Spanish Isle. For had it not
been revealed to him that this Veragua was the source
whence Solomon drew the gold to build the temple?
These lamentations continued during the remainder
of the storm, which lasted nine days longer; after
which preparations were made for the embarkation of
the colonists, the admiral consoling himself with the
promise of return under more favorable auspices.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_230' href='#Page_230'>230</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Finally the caravel stationed in the river was dismantled,
and out of the spars and some Indian
canoes was made a raft, by means of which the
colonists and their effects were in two days taken on
board. The admiral then bore away eastward for
Española. And it may have been the lingering hope
of blind infatuation—so his followers thought it—that
made him cling to the shore until the Darien
country was passed, before striking out across the
Caribbean Sea; others say it was to avoid contrary
winds, while he affirms it was to deceive his pilots
that they might not be able to find Veragua again
without his charts. One worm-eaten caravel he was
obliged to drop at Portobello. The other two held
together until they reached Jamaica, where they were
beached.
</p>

<p>
A new series of misfortunes here awaited the
Great Unlucky One. From June 1503 to June 1504
he was doomed to remain on his wrecks, which now
lay side by side, partially filled with water. Food became
scarce, and the foraging expeditions met with
constantly increasing difficulties in seeking the necessary
supply. By desperate efforts Diego Mendez
succeeded in reaching Española in a canoe; but when
he had notified Ovando of the perilous situation of
Columbus, the governor was in no haste to relieve
his rival. Sickness next followed, and then mutiny.
Francisco de Porras with forty-eight men threw off
allegiance to the admiral, and taking ten canoes set
out for Española. Twice thrown back upon Jamaica
by adverse winds they abandoned the attempt, and
gave themselves up to licentious roving about the
island. A second mutiny was near its culmination
when a small vessel appeared in the distance. Presently
Diego de Escobar approached in a boat, and
without leaving it, thrust in upon the admiral a letter,
a side of bacon, and a barrel of wine, all from Ovando;
then he disappeared as mysteriously as he had come.
Following an attempted reconciliation with Porras
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_231' href='#Page_231'>231</a></span>
was a fight between his gang and the Spaniards under
Bartolomé, in which six were killed, among them
our honest friend Juan Sanchez, who had cast his
lot with Porras. The doughty Ledesma, also a
rebel, though badly wounded, lived to be assassinated
in Spain. Porras and several others were taken
prisoners and confined on board the wreck. The
remainder of the deserters then returned, penitent.
Finally the admiral's agent at Santo Domingo, Diego
de Salcedo, came to his relief with two ships.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEATH OF THE ADMIRAL.</div>

<p>
It was infamous in Ovando to leave Columbus so
long in such a strait. The excuses he pleaded were
absence at Jaraguá, and lack of suitable ships; but
had he been in earnest to deliver the admiral, means
could have been found before the lapse of a year.
Although on arriving at Santo Domingo Columbus
received lodgings in Ovando's house, and the governor
was outwardly exceedingly attentive to his guest,
in reality there was little in common between the two
men but jealousy and distrust. Porras was allowed
to roam at large, though finally sent to Spain for trial.
Columbus sailed for Spain September 12, 1504. For
a time he kept his bed at Seville, writing heart-rending
letters to the sovereigns, who paid little attention
to them. By the help of the adelantado, ever his
most faithful friend and brother, Columbus managed
the following year to creep up to court and beg
redress from the king, for the queen was now dead.
But Ferdinand was deeply disgusted; not so much
however as to prevent his granting the illustrious discoverer
a magnificent burial shortly after. It was
the 20th of May, 1506, that Columbus died at Valladolid,
at the age of about seventy years.<a id='FA_IV-25' href='#FN_IV-25' class='fnanchor'>[IV-25]</a>
</p>

<p class="p2">
Thus terminated the first attempt of Spaniards to
plant a colony on the main-land of North America.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_232' href='#Page_232'>232</a></span>
Columbus himself, the leader, advanced with proffers
of friendship in one hand and a sword in the other,
retaliated upon a fancied savage treachery by a still
more insidious treachery, and was driven from the
country by a brave ruler, whose deeds deserve to be
enrolled beside those of patriots everywhere. One
kind act of a tender-hearted Spanish sailor—would I
had more of them to record in this history—brings
the direst misfortune on his countrymen, delays for a
dozen years the occupation of Veragua, and turns the
tide of conquest in other directions.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHARACTER OF COLUMBUS.</div>

<p class="p2">
Most remarkable in the character of Columbus was
the combination of the theoretical and the practical;
and most remarkable in his theories was the anomaly
that though nearly all of them were false, they led to
as grand results as if they had been true. The aperture
through which failure creeps into carefully laid
schemes is usually some glaring defect of character;
and such defect often appears where little suspected,
in natures warped by genius, or where one quality is
unduly developed at the expense of another quality.
We often see men of rare ability wrecked by what
would be regarded an act of folly unaccountable in
the stupidest person; but we do not often see success
resulting from these same defects. The greatest
defect in the faculties of Columbus, extravagance of
belief, was the primary cause of his success. Simple
to us as is the reality of the earth's rotundity, and of
the practicability of a western route to Asia, no one
could then have entertained those doctrines without
extraordinary credulity; even though Pythagoras
and others had so long ago expressed such ideas,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_233' href='#Page_233'>233</a></span>
no one could then have acted on them short of infatuation
bordering on insanity. To say the world is
round was not enough; Thales of Miletus proved it
not a plane two thousand years before. If it were
round, the water would run off; if it were flat, why
then one safely might sail on it; if it be flat, and the
water runs not off, then at the other end there must
be land that keeps the water on, and one might sail
over the flat sea to that land—all such logic was less
puerile than the feelings by which the Genoese ordinarily
reached conclusions. His efforts were the
embodiment of the ideas of many thoughtful men,
timorous persons, perhaps, or merely meditative and
passive, but in none of whom united his ability, courage,
and enthusiasm; above all, none so scientific
were at the same time so determined. Often the
knowledge of a prophecy is the cause of its fulfilment.
Some say Alonso Sanchez told him of Española, and
he himself affirms that once he visited Iceland. It
may have been that on this voyage he learned from
the Norsemen of their Vinland and Helluland. What
then? Were this true, such stories would have had
with him scarcely greater weight than the sayings of the
ancients, or than current interpretations of holy writ.
</p>

<p>
Nothing more plainly proves the power that sent
him forth than the fact that in scarcely one of his
original conceptions was he correct. He thought to
reach Asia over an unobstructed ocean sea by sailing
west; he did not. To the day of his death he
thought America was Asia, and that Cuba was mainland;
that the earth was much smaller than it is, and
that six sevenths of it was land. He dwelt much
on a society of Amazons who never had existence,
and at every step among the Islands he ingenuously
allowed his inflamed imagination to deceive him.
He claimed to have been divinely appointed for this
mission; he affirmed his voyage a miracle, and himself
inspired with the conception of it by the most holy
Trinity; he vowed to rescue the holy sepulchre,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_234' href='#Page_234'>234</a></span>
which he never did; he proclaimed visions which he
never saw, such as St Elmo at the top-mast with
seven lighted tapers, and told of voices which he
never heard; he pictured himself a missionary to benighted
heathen, when in truth he was scattering
among them legions of fiery devils. But what he
knew and did, assuredly, was enough, opening the
ocean to highways, and finding new continents;
enough to fully entitle him to all the glory man can
give to man; and as for his errors of judgment, had
he been able to map America as accurately as can
we to-day, had he been divine instead of, as he
claimed, only divinely appointed, with myriads of
attendant ministers, his achievement would have
been none the greater. From the infirmities of his
nature sprang the nobility of Brutus; from the weaknesses
of Columbus was compounded his strength.
</p>

<p>
Assuredly it was no part of the experience and
ingenuity which springs from life-long application
that made Columbus so essentially a visionary; nor
was it his scientific attainments, nor the splendid
successes which despite the so frequent frowns of
fortune we must accredit him. In his avocation
of mariner he was a plain, thoughtful man of sound
judgment and wise discretion; but fired by enthusiasm
he became more than an ordinary navigator; he became
more as he fancied himself, superhuman, the
very arm of omnipotence. Once born in him the
infatuation that he was the divinely appointed instrument
for the accomplishment of this work, and
frowning monarchs or perilous seas were as straws in
his way. We see clearly enough what moved him,
these four hundred years after the event, though
he who was moved in reality knew little about it.
By the pressure of rapidly accumulating ideas we
see brought to the front in discovery Christopher
Columbus, just as in the reformation of the church
Martin Luther is crowded to the front. The German
monk was not the Reformation; like the Genoese
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_235' href='#Page_235'>235</a></span>
sailor, he was but an instrument in the hands of a
power palpable to all, but called by different persons
different names.
</p>

<p>
While yet mingling in the excitements of progressive
manhood, he became lost in a maze of mysticism,
and to the end of his life he never recovered possession
of himself. Not that self-mastery, the first
necessity of correct conduct, was wholly gone; there
was method in his madness; and he could deny the
demons within him, but it was only to leave open the
door and give himself up to yet other demons.
</p>

<p>
In the centuries of battle now lately renewed between
science and religion, Columbus fought on both
sides. Never was a man more filled at once with the
material and the spiritual, with the emotional and
the intellectual. Mingling with beatified spirits in
the garden of his moral paradise were naked wild men
equally as glorious in their immoralities. His creed,
which was his very life, was not in his eyes a bundle
of supernatural abstractions, but concrete reality as
much as were any of his temporal affairs. Himself
an honest devotee of science, and believing science
the offspring of religion, science and himself must
therefore finally be forever laid upon the same altar.
He had no thought of work apart from religion, or
of religion apart from work. He had ready a doctrine
for every heavenly display, a theory for every
earthly phenomenon. When pictures of other lands
rose in his imagination, he knew them to be real, just
as Juan Diego of Mexico knew to be real the apparition
of our Lady of Guadalupe at Tepeyacac. By the
gnawing hunger of temporal and spiritual ambition
he was enabled to see the new lands suggested by
science, just as the imprisoned monk, starved and
scourged into the beholdings of insanity, sees angels
of every incarnation.
</p>

<p>
While thus obliged to view all his achievements
through the atmosphere of creative mysticism, in
weighing his manifold qualities, it is well always to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_236' href='#Page_236'>236</a></span>
remember that there were achievements, and those
of the very highest order. His mysticism was the
mysticism of practical life rather than of inactive
ideality. His faith was of value to him in giving
definiteness to energy otherwise vague and fitful.
His all-potential enthusiasm subordinated to one idea
every erratic and incoherent aspiration. It gave his
life a fixedness of purpose which lust, avarice, and every
appetite combined could not have given without it;
so that while he brooded with misanthropic wistfulness
he did not shirk any fancied duty, even when
attended by pain and misfortune. His was not a
cloistered inspiration, but an overwhelmingly active
enthusiasm. There was in him no longing after a
perfect life; in his own eyes his life was perfect.
No restless questionings over the unknowable; there
was no unknowable. His oblique imagination encompassed
all worlds and penetrated all space. His
positivism bound the metaphysical no less firmly
than the material. Abstract conceptions were more
tangible than concrete facts. Realities were but
accidents; ideas were the only true realities. The
highway of the heavens which to profoundest investigation
is dusty with the débris of an evolving
universe, to this self-sufficient sailor was as plain as
the king's road from Seville to Cádiz.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">ANOMALIES AND ABERRATIONS.</div>

<p>
And as genius grows with experience, so grew his
determination with the errors he so frequently fell into.
He was not a happy man, nor was he always a pleasant
companion. In his delusions he was self-satisfied; in
the loss of himself self-possessed. He endeavored to
be prudent and thought himself worldly wise; but,
like many self-flatterers wrapped in their own fancies
he was easily imposed upon, even by the sovereigns,
with whom he aimed to be exceedingly shrewd. His
contact with man did not deepen his humanity, but
seemed rather to harden his heart, and drive his affections
all the more from earth to heaven. His mind
was of that gloomy cast which made even his successes
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_237' href='#Page_237'>237</a></span>
sorrowful. We have seen among his practical
virtues integrity of a high conventional order, single-mindedness,
courage, and indomitable perseverance;
and in other characteristics which were not so pleasing—pride
displaying itself, as it often does, in religious
humility; a melancholy temper; a selfish ambition,
which with one grasp would secure to himself and
his family the uttermost that man and God could
give; with all his devout piety and heavenly zeal
a painful and often ludicrous tenacity in clutching
at high-sounding titles and hollow honors—there
were even in the most unlovable parts of him something
to respect, and in his selfishness a self-sacrificing
nobleness, a lofty abandonment of self to the idea,
which we can but admire. It was not for himself,
although it was always most zealously and jealously
for himself; the ships, the new lands, the new peoples,
his fortunes and his life, all were consecrate; should
the adventure prove successful, the gain would be
heaven's; if a failure, the loss would fall on him.
Surely the Almighty must smile on terms so favorable
to himself. And that he did not finally make
good his promises with regard to rescuing the holy
sepulchre, and building temples, and converting nations,
was for the same reason that he did not finally
satisfy his worldly pretensions, and secure himself
in his rulership. He had not the time. In all his
worldly and heavenly ambitions, the glory of God and
the glory of himself were blended with the happy consummation
of his grand idea. And never did morbid
broodings over the unsubstantial and shadowless produce
grander results than these incubations of alternate
exaltation and despondency that hatched a continent.
And in all that was then transpiring, there are few
intelligent readers of history who cannot see an overshadowing,
all-controlling destiny shaping events
throughout the world, so that this then unknown
continent should be prepared to fill the grand purpose
which even then appeared to be marked out for it.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_238' href='#Page_238'>238</a></span>
</p>

<p>
While, therefore, in the study of this remarkable
character, whose description is but a succession of
paradoxes, we see everywhere falsehood leading up
to truth and truth to falsehood; while we see spring
out of the ideal the real, results the most substantial
and success the most signal come from conceptions
the most fantastical, we can but observe, not only
that penetrative vision which in the mind of genius
sees through the symbol the divine significance, but
that they have not been always or altogether fruitless
of good, those spectral fancies which riot in absurdities,
building celestial cities, and peopling pandemoniums,
even in the absence of genius, symbol, or
significance.<a id='FA_IV-26' href='#FN_IV-26' class='fnanchor'>[IV-26]</a>

<p class="p2 blockquot">
Probably not one of the many accounts of Columbus which have been
published is presented with such fulness of detail, commanding vivid interest
from first to last, as that of Mr Washington Irving, <i>The Life and Voyages
of Christopher Columbus; to which are added those of His Companions</i>, 3 vols.,
New York, 1869. The first editions, one in London, in 4 vols., and one in
New York, appeared in 1828; since which time there have been many issues,
in English and other languages. The author was born in New York, in 1783,
and died at Sunnyside, near Tarrytown, on the Hudson River, in 1859. A
strong literary taste was early displayed, specially manifested in 1802 in a
series of articles contributed to the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>. In 1804 he visited
Europe for his health, returning in 1807. Then appeared the serial <i>Salmagundi</i>,
and in 1809 <i>A History of New York</i>. Again in 1815 he went to Europe,
and after engaging for a time in mercantile pursuits, abandoned them
and gave himself up to letters. The publication of the <i>Sketch Book</i> was begun
in numbers in 1818, and was followed by <i>Bracebridge Hall</i> in 1822, and <i>Tales
of a Traveller</i> in 1824. Then came <i>Columbus</i>, the material for which he obtained
from Navarrete in Spain. See <a href="#FN_III-9">chapter iii. note 9, this volume</a>. After
serving as secretary of the American Legation in London from 1829 to 1832,
he returned to New York and published <i>The Alhambra</i>; then <i>Crayon Miscellany</i>
in 1835;
<i>Astoria</i> in 1836;
<i>Captain Bonneville</i> in 1837; and <i>Wolfert's Roost</i>
in 1855. From 1842 to 1846 he was American Minister to Spain. His later
works were <i>Goldsmith</i>, 1849;
<i>Mahomet</i>, 1850; and <i>Washington</i>, 1855-9. Mr
Irving has been most praised for his genial manner, his gentleness of thought,
and his charming style, which carries the reader almost unconsciously along
over details in other hands dry and profitless. Among these is found his
highest merit; and yet one would sometimes wish the author not quite so
meritorious. Elegance and grace eternal tire by their very faultlessness. In
handling the rough realities of life one relishes now and then a rough
thought roughly expressed. Neither is Irving remarkable for historical
accuracy, or exact thinking. An early criticism on <i>Columbus</i> complains of
that without which the works of Irving never would have attained great
popularity. He was pronounced too wordy, his details too long drawn. If
this was the case fifty years ago, it is much more so now. And yet how
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_240' href='#Page_240'>240</a></span>
fascinating is every page! And who but Irving could make thrilling such
trivial events? Permit him the use of words, and howsoever isolated the
ideas, or commonplace the events, the result was brilliant; but force him
within narrow compass, not only would the charm be lost, but the work
would be almost worthless.

<p class="blockquot">
The highest delight of a healthy mind, of a mind not diseased either by
education or affection, is in receiving the truth. The greatest charm in expression,
to a writer who may properly be placed in the category of healthful,
is in telling the truth. It is only when truth is dearer to us than tradition, or
pride of opinion, that we are ready to learn; it is only when truth is dearer to
us than praise or profit that we are fit to teach. If the mind be intelligent
as well as healthy, it knows itself to be composed of truth and prejudice, the
latter engendered of ignorance and environment, holding it in iron fetters,
and with which it knows it must forever struggle in vain wholly to be
free. Thus keenly alive as well to the difficulties as to the importance of
right thinking and exact forms of expression, it nevertheless has its keenest
pleasure in striving toward concrete truth. It is truthfulness to nature in
all her beauties and deformities, rather than the construction of some more
beautiful than natural ideal, that alone satisfies art, whether in the domain of
painting, oratory, or literature. We of to-day, while holding in high esteem
works of the imagination, are becoming somewhat captious in regard to our
facts. The age is essentially informal and real; even our ideal literature must
be rigidly true to nature, while whatever pretends to be real must be presented
in all simplicity, without circumlocution or disguisement.

<p class="blockquot">
Half a century ago it was deemed necessary, particularly by writers of
selected epochs of history, in order to clothe their narrative with dramatic
effect equal to fiction, to intensify characters and events. The good qualities
of good men were made to stand out in bold relief, not against their own bad
qualities, but against the bad qualities of bad men, whose wickedness was
portrayed in such black colors as to overshadow whatever of good they might
possess. Thus historical episodes were endowed, so far as possible without
too great discoloration of truth, like a theatrical performance, each with a
perfected hero and a finished villain. Of this class of writers were Macaulay
and Motley, Froude, Freeman, Prescott, and Irving, whose works are wonderful
in their way, not only as art-creations, but as the truest as well as most
vivid pictures of their several periods yet presented, and which for generations
will be read with that deep and wholesome interest with which they deserve
to be regarded. For, although their facts are sometimes highly varnished,
their most brilliant creations are always built upon a substantial skeleton of
truth. I say that these, the foremost writers of their day, are none of them
free from the habit of exaggeration, deception. Indeed, with a wasteful extravagance
in the use of superlatives it is almost impossible to draw character
strongly without in some parts of it exaggerating. But in these days of rational
reflection wherein romance and reality are fairly separated, celestial
fiction and mundane fact being made to pass under the same <i>experimentum
crucis</i>; mind becoming so mechanical that it introverts and analyzes not only
its own mechanism but the mechanism of its maker; iconoclasm becoming
spiritualized, and the doctrine revived of the old Adamic serpent, that the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_241' href='#Page_241'>241</a></span>
knowledge of good and evil is not death but life and immortality, this knowledge
being king of kings, vying with nature's forces and oftentimes defying
them—I say, in days like these mature manhood becomes impatient of the
Santa Claus, or other fictitious imagery, from which the infant mind derives
much comfort, and prefers, if necessary, the torments of truth to the elysium
of fable. It is no longer valid logic that if the hero stoops to trickery, his
biographer should stoop to trickery to cover it. For once undertake to shape
the stiff clay of material facts into the artistic forms of fiction, and the result
is neither history nor romance.

<div class="sidenote">WASHINGTON IRVING.</div>

Proud as I am of the names of Prescott and Irving, at whose shrines none
worship with profounder admiration than myself; thankless as may be the
task of criticising their classic pages, whose very defects shine with a steadier
lustre than I dare hope for my brightest consummations; still, forced by my
subject, in some instances, into fields partially traversed by them, I can neither
pass them by nor wholly praise them. In justice to my theme, in justice to
myself, in justice to the age in which I live, I must speak, and that according
to the light and the perceptions given me.

<p class="blockquot">
Mr Irving's estimate of the value of honesty and integrity in a historian
may be gathered from his own pages. "There is a certain meddlesome spirit,"
he writes, "which, in the garb of learned research, goes prying about the
traces of history, casting down its monuments, and marring and mutilating
its fairest trophies. Care should be taken to vindicate great names from such
pernicious erudition. It defeats one of the most salutary purposes of history,
that of furnishing examples of what human genius and laudable enterprise
may accomplish." Now, if conscientious inquiry into facts signifies a meddlesome
spirit; if the plain presentment of facts may rightly be called pernicious
erudition; if the overthrow of fascinating falsehood is mutilating the
trophies of history; if fashioning golden calves for the worship of the simple
be the most salutary purpose of history; then I, for one, prefer the meddlesome
spirit and the pernicious erudition which mutilates such monuments to
the fairest trophies of historical deception. Again—"Herrera has been accused
also of flattering his nation; exalting the deeds of his countrymen, and
softening and concealing their excesses. There is nothing very serious in this
accusation. To illustrate the glory of his nation is one of the noblest offices
of the historian; and it is difficult to speak too highly of the extraordinary
enterprises and splendid actions of the Spaniards in those days. In softening
their excesses he fell into an amiable and pardonable error, if it were indeed
an error for a Spanish writer to endeavor to sink them in oblivion." When
a writer openly avows his allegiance to falsehood, to amiable falsehood, to
falsehood perpetrated to deceive in regard to one's own country, about which
one professes to know more than a stranger, nothing remains to be said.
Nothing remains to be said as to the veracity of that author, but much
remains to be said concerning the erroneous impressions left by him of the
persons and events coming in the way of this work.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
With what exquisite grace, with what tender solicitude and motherly blindness
to faults Mr Irving defends the reputation of Columbus! Is the Genoese
a pirate, then is piracy "almost legalized;" is he a slave-maker, "the customs
of the times" are pleaded; without censure he lives at Córdova in open adultery
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_242' href='#Page_242'>242</a></span>
with Beatriz Enriquez, and there becomes the father of the illegitimate
Fernando; a bungling attempt is made to excuse the hero for depriving the
poor sailor of the prize offered him who should first see land; Oviedo is charged
with falsehood because he sometimes decides against the discoverer in issues
of policy and character; Father Buil was "as turbulent as he was crafty" because
he disagreed with the admiral in some of his measures; the most extravagant
vituperation is hurled at Aguado because he is chosen to examine and
report on the affairs of the Indies; Fonseca is denounced as inexpressibly vile
because he thwarts some of the discoverer's hare-brained projects; and so with
regard to those who in any wise opposed him, while all who smiled on him
were angels of light. All through his later life when extravagant requests
were met by more than the usual liberality of royalty, Irving is petulantly
complaining because more is not done for his hero, and because his petulant
hero complains. And this puerile pride from which springs such petulance
the eloquent biographer coins into the noble ambition of conscious merit.
Though according to his own statement the madness of the man increased
until toward the latter end he was little better than imbecile, yet we are at
the same time gravely assured that "his temper was naturally irritable, but
he subdued it by the magnanimity of his spirit." The son Fernando denies
that his father once carded wool; Irving does not attempt to excuse this blemish
because his readers do not regard work ignoble.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
Now it is not the toning-down of defects in a good man's character that I
object to so much as the predetermined exaltation of one historical personage
at the expense of others utterly debased under like premeditation. Did Mr
Irving, and the several scores of biographers preceding and following him,
parade the good qualities of Bobadilla, Roldan, and Ovando as heartily as
those of their hero, the world would be puzzled what to make of it. We are
not accustomed to such statements. Unseasoned biography is tasteless, and
we are taught not to expect truth, but a model. We should not know what
these writers were trying to do if they catalogued the misdemeanors of
Columbus and his brothers with the same embellishments applied to Aguado,
Buil, and Fonseca; telling with pathetic exaggeration how the benign admiral
of the ocean sea was the first to employ bloodhounds against the naked natives;
how he practised varied cruelties in Española beyond expression barbarous;
and how he stooped upon occasion not only to vulgar trickery, but to
base treachery.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
On the other hand, with those who seek notoriety by attempting to degrade
the fair fame of noble and successful genius because more credit may have been
given by some than is justly due, or by affecting to disbelieve whole narratives
and whole histories because portions of them are untrue or too highly
colored, I have no sympathy. Books have been written to prove, what no
one denies, that centuries before Columbus other Europeans had found this
continent, and that thereby the honor of his achievement is lessened—of
which sentiment I fail to see the force. So far as the Genoese, his works,
and merits are concerned, it makes no whit difference were America twenty
times before discovered, as elsewhere in this volume has been fully shown.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">IRVING AND PRESCOTT COMPARED.</div>

<p class="blockquot">
Prescott was a more exact writer than Irving, though Prescott was not
wholly above the amiable weakness of his time. In the main he stated the

truth, and stated it fairly, though he did not always tell the whole truth.
The faults of his heroes he would speak, though never so softly; he seldom
attempted entirely to conceal them. He might exaggerate, but he neither
habitually practised nor openly defended mendacity. Prescott would fain
please the Catholics, if it did not cost too much. Irving would please everybody,
particularly Americans; but most of all he would make a pleasing tale;
if truthful, well; if not, it must on no account run counter to popular prejudice.
The inimitable charm about them both amply atones in the minds of
many for any imperfections. Since their day much new light has been thrown
upon the subjects treated by them, but not enough seriously to impair the
value of their works. In their estimates of the characters of Ferdinand and
Isabella, relatively and respectively, these brilliant writers are not alone.
They copied those who wrote before them; and those who came after copied
them. It has been the fashion these many years, both by native and foreign
historians, to curse Ferdinand and to bless Isabella, to heap all the odium of
the nation and the times upon the man and exalt the woman among the stars.
This, surely, is the more pleasant and chivalrous method of disposing of the
matter; but in that case I must confess myself at a loss what to do with the
facts.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">FERDINAND AND ISABELLA.</div>

<p class="blockquot">
None but the simple are deceived by the gentle Irving when he insinuates
"she is even somewhat bigoted;" by which expression he would have us understand
that the fascinating queen of Castile was but little of a bigot. Again:
"Ferdinand was a religious bigot; and the devotion of Isabella went as near
to bigotry as her liberal mind and magnanimous spirit would permit"—that is
to say, as the plan of Mr Irving's story would permit. Quite as well as any
of us Irving knew that Isabella was one of the most bigoted women of her
bigoted age, far more bigoted than Ferdinand, who dared even dispute the
pope when his Holiness interfered too far in attempting to thwart his ambitious
plans. She was, indeed, so deeply dyed a bigot as to allow her ghostly
confessor to overawe her finest womanly instincts, her commonly strict sense
of honor, justice, and humanity, and cause her to permit in Spain the horrible
Inquisition, the most monstrous mechanism of torture ever invented in aid of
the most monstrous crime ever perpetrated by man upon his fellows, the coercion
and suppression of opinion. Fair as she was in all her ways, and charming—fair
of heart and mind and complexion, with regular features, light chestnut
hair, mild blue eyes, a modest and gracious demeanor—she did not scruple, for
the extermination of heresy, to apply to such of her loving subjects as dared
think for themselves the thumb-screw, the ring-bolt and pulley, the rack, the
rolling-bench, the punch, the skewer, the pincers, the knotted whip, the sharp-toothed
iron collar, chains, balls, and manacles, confiscation of property and
burning at the stake; and all under false accusations and distorted evidence.
She did not hesitate to seize and put to death hundreds of wealthy men like
Pecho, and appropriate to her own use their money, though her exquisite
womanly sensibilities might sometimes prompt her to fling to the widows and
children whom she had turned beggars into the street a few crumbs of their
former riches. This mother, who nursed children of her own and who should
not have been wholly ignorant of a mother's love, turned a deaf ear to the cries
of Moorish mothers as they and their children were torn asunder and sold at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_244' href='#Page_244'>244</a></span>
the slave mart in Seville. Thousands of innocent men, women, and children
she cruelly imprisoned, thousands she cast into the fiery furnace, tens of
thousands she robbed and then drove into exile; but it was chastely done, and
by a most sweet and beautiful lady. We can hardly believe it true, we do
not like to believe it true, that when old Rabbi Abarbanel pleaded before
the king for his people, "I will pay for their ransom six hundred thousand
crowns of gold," Isabella's soft, musical voice was heard to say, "Do not
take it," her confessor meanwhile exclaiming "What! Judas-like, sell Jesus!"
Besides, thrice six hundred thousand crowns might be secured by not accepting
the ransom. And yet this was the bright being, and such her acts by
Prescott's own statements, cover them as he will never so artfully, whose
practical wisdom, he assures us, was "founded on the purest and most exalted
principle," and whose "honest soul abhorred anything like artifice." Isabella
was unquestionably a woman of good intentions; but with such substance the
soul-burner's pit is paved.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
Prescott throws all the odium of the Inquisition on Torquemada, and I
concur. The monk's mind was the ashy, unmelting mould in which the woman's
more plastic affections were cast. But then he should be accredited with
some portion of the virtues that adorned the character of Isabella, for he was
the author of many of them. To be just, if Isabella is accredited with her
virtues, she must be charged with her crimes. And if the queen may throw
from her shoulders upon those of her advisers the responsibility of iniquity
permitted under her rule, why not King Ferdinand, who likewise had men
about him urging him to this policy and to that? True, we excuse much in
woman as the weaker, and very justly so, which we condemn in the man of
powerful cunning. But Isabella was not exactly clay in the hands of those
about her; or if so, then praise her for her imbecility, and not for any
virtue. But she could muster will and spirit enough of her own upon occasion—witness
her threat to kill Pedro Giron with her own hand rather than
marry him, and the policy which speaks plainly her sagacity and state-craft in
the selection of Ferdinand, and in the strict terms of her marriage contract
which excluded her husband from any sovereign rights in Castile or Leon.
Most inconsistently, indeed, in reviewing the administration of Isabella, at
the end of three volumes of unadulterated adulation Prescott gives his heroine
firmness enough in all her ways; independence of thought and action sufficient
to circumscribe the pretensions of her nobles; and she "was equally
vigilant in resisting ecclesiastical encroachment;" "she enforced the execution
of her own plans, oftentimes even at great personal hazard, with a resolution
surpassing that of her husband." When, however, she signed the edict for
the expulsion of the Jews, the excuse was that "she had been early schooled
to distrust her own reason." But why multiply quotations? The <i>Ferdinand
and Isabella</i> of Prescott is full of these flat contradictions.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
We all know that when carried away by feeling women are more cruel than
men; so Isabella under the frenzy of her fanaticism was, if possible, more cruel
than Ferdinand, whose passions were ballasted by his ambitions. Her feelings
were with her faith; and her faith was with such foul iniquity, such inhuman
wrong as should cause her euphemistic apologists to blush for resorting to the
same species of subterfuge that makes heroes of Jack Sheppard and Dick Turpin.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_245' href='#Page_245'>245</a></span>
Again, murder and robbery for Christ's sake suits the devil quite as well as
when done for one's own sake. And here on earth, to plead in a court of
justice good intentions in mitigation of evil acts nothing extenuates in the
eyes of any righteous judge. Therefore there is little to choose between those
of whom it may be said—Here is a man who perfidiously robs, tortures, and
murders his fellow-beings by the hundred thousand in order to glorify himself,
and extend and establish his dominions; and, Here is a woman who perfidiously
robs, tortures, and murders her fellow-beings by the hundred thousand in
order to glorify herself, her priest, her religion, and extend and establish the
dominions of her deity. At the farthest, and in the minds of the eloquent
biographers themselves, the relative refinement and nobility of the two characters
must turn wholly upon one's conception of the relative refinement and
nobility of earthly selfishness and heavenly selfishness.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
What can we say then, if we make any pretensions to fairness in portraying
historical personages, in excuse for Isabella that cannot as rightfully
be said in excuse for Ferdinand? For even he, whom sensational biographers
array in such sooty blackness in order that the satin robes of Isabella may
shine with whiter lustre, has been called in Spain the wise and prudent, and
in Italy the pious. Of course there were differences in their dispositions and
their ambitions, but not such wide ones as we have been told. He was a
man, with a man's nature, cold, coarse, stern, and artful; she a woman, with
a woman's nature, warm, refined, gentle, and artful. He was foxlike, she
feline. Opposing craft with craft, she jealously guarded what she deemed
the interests of her subjects, and earnestly sought by encouraging literature
and art, and reforming the laws, to refine and elevate her realm. He did
precisely the same. In all the iniquities of his lovely consort Ferdinand lent
a helping hand; man could do nothing worse; and all the world agree that
Ferdinand was bad. And yet, in what was he worse than she? Both were
tools of the times, incisive and remorseless. To the ecclesiastical tyranny of
which they were victims they added civil tyranny which they imposed upon
their subjects. Ferdinand was the greatest of Spain's sovereigns, far greater
than Charles, whose fortune it was to reap where his grandfather had planted.
It was Ferdinand who consolidated all the several sovereignties of the Peninsula,
save Portugal, into one political body, weighty in the affairs of Europe.
He was ambitious; and to accomplish his ends scrupled at nothing. There
was no sin he dared not commit, no wrong he dared not inflict, provided the
proximate result should accord with his desires. He was less bound by
superstition than the average of the age; he was thoughtful, powerful,
princely. Both were personages magnificent, glorious, who achieved much
good and much evil, the evil being as fully chargeable to the times, which
placed princes above promises and religion, above integrity and humanity, as
to any special depravity innate in either of them. And what was the immediate
result of it; and what the more distant conclusion; and how much
after all were Spaniards indebted to these rulers? First Spain enwrapped in
surpassing glories! Spain the mistress of the world, on whose dominions the
sun refuses to go down. Fortunate Ferdinand! Thrice amiable and virtuous
Isabella! And next? Do we not see that these brilliant successes, these
gratified covetings are themselves the seeds of Spain's abasement? Infinitely
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_246' href='#Page_246'>246</a></span>
better off were Spain to-day, I will not say had she not driven out her Moors
and Jews, but had she never known the New World. How much soever of
honor Isabella may have brought upon herself by her speculations in partnership
with the Genoese, for the self-same reason, resulting in the great
blight of gold and general effeminacy that followed, Spain's posterity might
reasonably anathematize her memory could they derive any comfort therefrom.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
In regard to that much-lauded act of Isabella's in lending her assistance
to Columbus when Ferdinand would not, there is this to be said. First, no
special praise is due her for assisting the Genoese; and secondly, she never
assisted him in the manner or to the extent represented. Santángel and the
Pinzons were the real supporters of that first voyage. Isabella did not pawn
her jewels; she did not sell her wardrobe, or empty her purse. But if she
had, for what would it have been? It makes a pleasing story for children to
call her patronage by pretty names, to say that it was out of pity for the poor
sailor, that it was an act of personal sacrifice for the public good, that it was
for charity's sake, or from benevolence, for the extension of knowledge or the
vindication of some great principle—only it is a very stupid child that does not
know better. Clearly enough the object was great returns from a small expenditure;
great returns in gold, lands, honors, and proselytings—a species of
commercial and political gambling more in accordance with the character as
commonly sketched of the "cold and crafty Ferdinand," whose measureless
avarice and insatiable greed not less than his subtle state-craft and kingly
cunning would have prompted him to secure so great a prize at so small a
cost, than with the character of an unselfish, heavenly-minded woman. And
were it not for the danger of being regarded by the tender-minded as ungallant,
I might allude to the haggling which attended the bargain, and tell how
the queen at first refused to pay the sailor his price, and let him go, then
called him back and gave him what he first had asked, more like a Jew than
like even the grasping Ferdinand.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
In conclusion, I feel it almost unnecessary to say that Columbus, Isabella,
and all those bright examples of history whose conduct and influence in the
main were on the side of humanity, justice, the useful, and the good, have
my most profound admiration, my most intelligent respect. All their faults
I freely forgive, and praise them for what they were, as among the noblest,
the best, the most beneficial to their race—though not always so, nor always
intending it—of any who have come and gone before us. And I can hate
Bobadilla, Roldan, and others of their sort, all historical embodiments of injustice,
egotism, treachery, and beastly cruelty, with a godly hatred; but I hope
never to be so blinded by the brightness of my subject as to be unable to
see the truth, and seeing it, fairly to report it.

<p>
We have seen how it had been first of all agreed
that Columbus should be sole ruler, under the crown,
of such lands and seas as he might discover for Spain.
We have seen how, under that rule, disruption and
rebellion followed at the heels of mismanagement,
until the restless colonists made Española an <i>angustiarum
insula</i> to the worthy admiral, and until their
majesties thought they saw in it decent excuse for
taking the reins from the Genoese, and supplanting
him by agents of their own choosing. The first of
these agents was Juan Aguado, who was merely a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_248' href='#Page_248'>248</a></span>
commissioner of inquiry. With him, it will be remembered,
Columbus returned to Spain after his
second voyage, leaving his brother Bartolomé in command.
The admiral was permitted to try again; but
on reaching the seat of his government he was unable
to quiet the disturbances which had increased during
his absence. Rebellion had almost reached the dignity
of revolution, and stronger than the government
were factions whose leaders openly defied the governor-general,
viceroy, and admiral of the ocean sea.
That their Majesties were greatly grieved at this, I
do not say; or that they were displeased that the
rebels, or revolutionists, of Española should refer
their troubles to them. But this is certain, that
after another fair trial Columbus was obliged to give
it up, and to see himself displaced by a person far
worse than himself. Perhaps it is true that a knave
was better for the office than an honest man.
</p>

<p>
Not that Francisco de Bobadilla may be lawfully
accused of dishonesty; the sovereigns seemed competent
to take care of themselves where their revenue
was concerned. And yet he was certainly influenced
in his conduct by no sense of right or of humanity.
He was a man of narrow mind, of ignoble instincts
and mean prejudices. He was popular for a time
with the colonists because he was like them, and because
he reduced the royal share of the product of the
mines from a third to an eleventh, and permitted the
dissolute to idle their time and illtreat the natives;
and because he released those whom the admiral had
imprisoned, and enabled Columbus to pay his debts—for
which last mentioned measure I have no fault to
find with him.
</p>

<p>
It was the 21st of March, 1499, that Bobadilla was
authorized to proceed against offenders at Española,
but he did not leave Spain until July, 1500, reaching
Santo Domingo the 23d of August. The enchaining
of the illustrious discoverer by an infamous agent,
and for no crime, excited universal disgust throughout
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_249' href='#Page_249'>249</a></span>
Christendom; and yet their Majesties seemed in no
haste to depose him; for it was not until the 3d of
September, 1501, in answer to the persistent remonstrances
of Columbus, that a change was made, and
the government given to Nicolas de Ovando, who
sailed from Spain the 13th of February following,
and arrived at Santo Domingo the 15th of April,
1502; so that Bobadilla was in office on the island
over a year and a half, long enough to sow the seeds
of much iniquity.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">NICOLAS DE OVANDO.</div>

<p>
Ovando was a knight of the order of Alcántara,
of neither massive mind nor commanding mien. But
his firm and fluent speech lent strength to his slight
figure and fair complexion, and a courteous manner
made amends for a vanity which in him assumed the
form of deep humility. He was well known to their
Majesties, having been one of the companions of Prince
Juan, and it was thought would make a model governor.
Ample instructions, both written and verbal,
were given him before sailing. The natives should
be converted, but their bodies should not be enslaved
or inhumanly treated. They must pay tribute, and
gather gold, but for the latter they should be paid
wages. There was to be a complete change of soldiers
and officials at Española, that the new government
might begin untainted by the late disorders. Neither
Jews nor Moors might go to the Indies, but negro
slaves, born into the possession of Christians, were to
be permitted passage. For any loss resulting from
Bobadilla's acts, full restitution must be made the admiral,
and henceforth his rights of property must be
respected. Columbus might always keep there an
agent to collect his dues, and he was to be treated
with consideration. The idle and profligate were to
be returned to Spain. Except the provinces given to
Ojeda and Pinzon, Ovando's jurisdiction was made
to extend over all the Indies, that is to say, over all
the New World dominions of Spain, islands and firm
land, with the capital at Santo Domingo, and subordinate
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_250' href='#Page_250'>250</a></span>
or municipal governments in the more important
localities. All mining licenses issued by Bobadilla
were to be revoked; of the gold thus far collected
one third should be taken for the crown, and of all
thereafter gathered one half. Supplementing these
instructions with much paternal advice consisting of
minor moralities and Machiavelisms, their Majesties
bade their viceroy God speed and sent him forth in a
truly royal fashion.
</p>

<p>
There were no less than thirty ships and twenty-five
hundred persons comprising the expedition. Of
the company were Alonso Maldonado, newly appointed
<i>alcalde mayor</i>,<a id='FA_V-1' href='#FN_V-1' class='fnanchor'>[V-1]</a> and twelve Franciscans, with
a prelate, Antonio de Espinal. Las Casas was present;
and Hernan Cortés would have been there but
for an illness which prevented him. There were
seventy-three respectable married women, who had
come with their husbands and children, and who
were to salt society at their several points of distribution.
It was evident as the new governor entered
his capital, elegantly attired, with a body-guard of
sixty-two foot-soldiers and ten horsemen, and a large
and brilliant retinue, that the colonization of the
New World had now been assumed in earnest by
the sovereigns of Spain. Nor was Ovando disposed
to be dilatory in his duty. He at once announced the
<i>residencia</i><a id='FA_V-2' href='#FN_V-2' class='fnanchor'>[V-2]</a> of Bobadilla, and put Roldan, <i>ci-devant</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_251' href='#Page_251'>251</a></span>
rebel, and later chief judge, under arrest. He built
in Española several towns to which arms and other
privileges were given, founded a hospital, removed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_252' href='#Page_252'>252</a></span>
Santo Domingo to a more healthful site on the
other side of the river, and established a colony at
Puerto de Plata, on the north side of Española, near
Isabela.
</p>

<p>
Distant eight leagues from Santo Domingo were
the mines where the twenty-five hundred thought
immediately to enrich themselves. For several days
after landing the road was alive with eager gold
hunters drawn from all classes of the community;
cavalier, <i>hidalgo</i>,<a id='FA_V-3' href='#FN_V-3' class='fnanchor'>[V-3]</a> and laborer, priest and artisan,
honest men and villains, whose cupidity had been fired
by the display of precious metal lately gathered, and
who were now hurrying forward with hard breath
and anxious eyes under their bundle of necessities.
But there was no happy fortune in store for these
new-comers. The story then new has been oft repeated
since: expecting to fill their sacks quickly and
with ease, and finding that a very little gold was to
be obtained only by very great labor, they were soon
on their way back to the city, where many of them
fell into poverty, half of them dying of fever.
</p>

<p>
Poor fools! they did not know; their countrymen,
those that were left from former attempts, did not tell
them, though Roldan's men, Bobadilla's men knew
well enough, and in truth the remnant of Ovando's
men were not slow to learn, that the wise man, the wise
and villainous man from Spain, did not work or die for
gold, or for anything else, when there were savages
that might be pricked to it by the sword.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_253' href='#Page_253'>253</a></span>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">GOVERNMENT OF THE NATIVES.</div>

<p>
During this earliest period of Spanish domination
in America, under successive viceroys and subordinate
rulers, by far the most important matter which arose
for consideration or action was the treatment of the
aborigines. Most momentous to them it was, certainly,
and of no small consequence to Spain. Unfortunately,
much damage was done before the subject
was fairly understood; and afterward, evils continued
because bad men were always at hand ready to risk
future punishment for present benefits. Spain was
so far away, and justice moved so slowly, if it moved
at all, that this risk was seldom of the greatest.
</p>

<p>
The sovereigns of Spain now found themselves
called upon to rule two races in the New World, the
white and the red. And it was not always easy to
determine what should be done, what should be the
relative attitude of one toward the other. As to the
superiority of the white race there was no question.
And among white men, Spaniards were the natural
masters; and among Spaniards, Castilians possessed
the first rights in the new lands the Genoese had
found for them.
</p>

<p>
All was plain enough so far. It was natural and
right that Spaniards should be masters in America.
Their claim was twofold; as discoverers, and as propagandists.
But in just what category to place the
red man was a question almost as puzzling as to tell
who he was, and whence he came. Several times
the question arose as to whether he had a soul, or
a semi-soul, and whether the liquid so freely let by
the conquerors was brute blood, or of as high proof
as that which ran in Castilian veins. The savages
were to be governed, of course; but how, as subjects
or as slaves? Columbus was strongly in favor
of Indian slavery. He had participated in the
Portuguese slave-trade, and had found it profitable.
Spaniards enslaved infidels, and why not heathens?
Mahometans enslaved Christians, and Christians
Mahometans. Likewise Christians enslaved Christians,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_254' href='#Page_254'>254</a></span>
white as well as black, though it began to be
questioned in Spain whether it was quite proper to
enslave white Christians.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">SLAVERY.</div>

<p>
The negro slave-trade was at this time comparatively
a new thing. It was one of the proximate
results of fifteenth-century maritime discovery. The
Portuguese were foremost in it, organizing for the
purpose a company at Lagos, and a factory at Arguin,
about the middle of the century, Prince Henry receiving
his fifth. Europe, however, offered no profitable
field for African slave labor, and but for the
discovery of America the traffic probably never would
have assumed large proportions. Public sentiment
was not in those days averse to slavery, particularly
to the enslavement of the children of Ham. And
yet neither Isabella nor Ferdinand was at all disposed,
in regard to their New World possessions, to
follow the example of Portugal on the coast of Africa.
Though they had scarcely made personal the application
that the practice was one of the chief causes
of Rome's ruin, yet they seemed instinctively opposed
to it in this instance. They did not want these
creatures in Spain, they had no use for them. In
regard to the ancient custom of enslaving prisoners of
war, particularly the detested and chronically hostile
Moors, it was different. This New World had been
given them for a higher purpose. Its natives were
not the enemies of Spain; they were innocent of any
offence against Spain. It was better, it was more
glorious, there was higher and surer reward in it,
to Christianize than to enslave. This the clergy
constantly urged; so that in Spain the passion for
propagandism was greater than the passion for enslaving.
</p>

<p>
Columbus must have been aware of this when in
1495 he sent by Torres, with the four ship-loads of
Indian slaves, the apology to their Majesties that
these were man-eating Caribs, monsters, the legitimate
prey of slave-makers wherever found. Peradventure
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_255' href='#Page_255'>255</a></span>
some of them might be made Christians, who when
they had learned Castilian could be sent back to
serve as missionaries and interpreters to aid in delivering
their countrymen from the powers of darkness.
This was plausible, and their Majesties seemed content;
but when Columbus pressed the matter further,
and requested that arrangements should be made for
entering extensively into the traffic, they hesitated.
Meanwhile the Genoese launched boldly forth in the
old way, not only making slaves of cannibals but of
prisoners of war; and whenever slaves were needed,
a pretence for war was not long wanting. Thereupon,
with another shipment, the admiral grows
jubilant, and swears by the holy Trinity that he can
send to Spain as many slaves as can be sold, four
thousand if necessary, and enters upon the details
of capture, carriage, sale, and return cargoes of goods,
with all the enthusiasm of a sometime profitable
experience in the business. Further than this he
permits enforced labor where there had been failure
to pay tribute, and finally gives to every one who
comes an Indian for a slave.
</p>

<p>
Then the monarchs were angry. "What authority
from me has the admiral to give to any one my vassals!"
exclaimed the queen. All who had thus been stolen
from home and country, among whom were pregnant
women and babes newly born, were ordered returned.
And from that moment the sovereigns of Spain were
the friends of the Indians. Not Isabella alone but
Ferdinand, Charles, and Philip, and their successors
for two hundred years with scarcely an exceptional
instance, stood manfully for the rights of the savages—always
subordinate however to their own
fancied rights—constantly and determinately interposing
their royal authority between the persistent
wrong-doing of their Spanish subjects, and their
defenceless subjects of the New World. Likewise
the Catholic Church is entitled to the highest praise
for her influence in the direction of humanity, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_256' href='#Page_256'>256</a></span>
for the unwearied efforts of her ministers in guarding
from cruelty and injustice these poor creatures. Here
and there in the course of this narrative we find a
priest carried away by the spirit of proselytism commit
acts of folly and unrighteousness; and men announcing
as church measures proceedings which when known
in the mother country received the prompt condemnation
of the church. These men and measures I
shall not be backward to condemn. But it is with
no small degree of pleasure that I record thus early
in this history the noble attributes of the self-sacrificing
Christian heroes who while preaching their faith
to the savage endeavored to bridle as best they could
the cupidity and cruelty of the Spanish adventurers
who accompanied them.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">LAWS RESPECTING THE ABORIGINES.</div>

<p>
After the first invasions, in various quarters, aggressive
warfare on the natives, even on obdurate
heathen nations, was prohibited. In the extension
of dominion that followed, the very word 'conquest'
was forbidden to be employed, even though it were a
conquest gained by fighting, and the milder term
'pacification' was substituted.<a id='FA_V-4' href='#FN_V-4' class='fnanchor'>[V-4]</a> Likewise, after the
first great land robberies had been committed, side
by side with the minor seizures was in practice the
regulation that enough of the ancient territory should
be left each native community to support it comfortably
in a fixed residence. The most that was
required of the Indians was to abolish their ancient
inhuman practices, put on the outward apparel of civilization,
and as fast as possible adapt themselves to
Christian customs, paying a light tax, in kind, nominally
for protection and instruction. This doing, they
were to be left free and happy. Such were the wishes
of crown and clergy; for which both strove steadily
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_257' href='#Page_257'>257</a></span>
though unsuccessfully until the object of their solicitude
crumbled into earth.<a id='FA_V-5' href='#FN_V-5' class='fnanchor'>[V-5]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_258' href='#Page_258'>258</a></span>
</p>

<p>
For the soldier, the sailor, the cavalier, the vagabond,
the governor, and all their subordinates and
associates, all the New World rabble from viceroy to
menial willed it otherwise, the New World clergy too
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_259' href='#Page_259'>259</a></span>
often winking assent. However omnipotent in Spain,
there were some things in America that the sovereigns
and their confessors could not do. They could
not control the bad passions of their subjects when
beyond the reach of rope and dungeon. That these
evil proclivities were of home engendering, having
for their sanction innumerable examples from church
and state, statesmen and prelates would hardly admit,
but it is in truth a plausible excuse for the excesses
committed. The fact is that for every outrage by a
subject in the far away Indies, there were ten, each
of magnitude tenfold for evil, committed by the sovereigns
in Spain; so that it is by no means wonderful
that the Spaniards determined here to practise a little
sinfulness for their own gratification, even though their
preceptors did oppose wickedness which by reason of
their absence they themselves could not enjoy.
</p>

<p>
Though the monarchs protested earnestly, honestly,
and at the length of centuries, their subjects went
their way and executed their will with the natives.
Were I to tell a tenth of the atrocities perpetrated by
Christian civilization on the natives of America, I
could tell nothing else. The catalogue of European
crime, Spanish, English, French, is as long as it is
revolting. Therefore, whenever I am forced to touch
upon this most distasteful subject, I shall be as brief
as possible.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">DASTARDLY DOINGS OF OVANDO.</div>

<p>
Passing the crimes of Columbus and Bobadilla, the
sins of the two being, for biographical effect, usually
placed upon the latter, let us look at the conduct
of Ovando, who, as Spanish provincial rulers went
in those days, was an average man. He ruled with
vigor; and as if to offset his strict dealings with
offending Spaniards, unoffending Indians were treated
with treachery and merciless brutality.
</p>

<p>
Rumor reaching him that Anacaona, queen of Jaraguá,
meditated revolt, he marched thither at the
head of two hundred foot-soldiers and seventy horsemen.
The queen came out to meet him, and escorted
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_260' href='#Page_260'>260</a></span>
him with music and dancing to the great banqueting-hall,
and entertained him there for several days. Still
assured by evil tongues that his hostess intended
treachery, he determined to forestall her. On a
Sunday afternoon, while a tilting-match was in progress,
Ovando gave the signal. He raised his hand
and touched his Alcántara cross—a badge of honor
it was called, which, had it been real, should have
shrivelled the hand that for such a purpose touched it.
On the instant Anacaona and her caciques were seized
and a mock trial given them; after which the queen
was hanged, the caciques tortured and burned, and the
people of the province, men, women, and children,
ruthlessly and indiscriminately butchered. Those who
escaped the massacre were afterward enslaved. For
intelligence, grace, and beauty Anacaona was the Isabella
of the Indies, and there was no valid proof that
she meditated the slightest injury to the Spaniards.
</p>

<p>
The natives of Saona and Higuey, in revenge for
the death of a chief torn in pieces by a Spanish bloodhound,
rose to arms, and slew a boat's crew of eight
Spaniards. Juan de Esquivel with four hundred men
was sent against them, and the usual indiscriminate
hanging and burning followed. It is stated that over
six hundred were slaughtered at one time in one house.
A peace was conquered, a fort built; fresh outrages
provoked a fresh outbreak; and the horrors of the
extermination that followed Las Casas confessed himself
unable to describe. A passion arose for mutilation,
and for prolonging agony by new inventions for
refining cruelty. And the irony of Christianity was
reached when thirteen men were hanged side by side
in honor of Christ and his apostles. Cotubano, the
last of the five native kings of Española, was taken
to Santo Domingo, and hanged by order of Ovando.
In Higuey were then formed two settlements, Salvaleon
and Santa Cruz. To take the places in the
Spanish service of the Indians thus slain in Española,
forty thousand natives of the Lucayas Islands were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_261' href='#Page_261'>261</a></span>
enticed thither upon the pretext of the captors that
they were the Indians' dead ancestors come from
heaven to take their loved ones back with them.
Española was indeed their shortest way to heaven,
though not the way they had been led to suppose.
When tidings of Ovando's doings reached Spain,
notably of his treatment of Anacaona, Queen Isabella
was on her death-bed; but raising herself as best she
was able, she exclaimed to the president of the council,
"I will have you take of him such a residencia as was
never taken."
</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LABOR QUESTION.</div>

<p class="p2">
Both the Spaniards and the Indians, as we have
seen, were averse to labor. To both it was degrading;
to the latter, killing. And yet it was necessary that
mines should be worked, lands cultivated, and cattle
raised. Else of what avail was the New World?
</p>

<p>
The colonists clamored, and the crown was at a loss
what to do. In her dilemma there is no wonder the
queen appeared to equivocate; but when in December,
1503, she permitted Ovando to use force in bringing
the natives to a sense of their duty, though they
must be paid fair wages and made to work "as free
persons, for so they are," she committed a fatal error.
The least latitude was sure to be abused. Under
royal permission of 1501 a few negro slaves from time
to time were taken to the Indies. Las Casas urged
the extension of this traffic in order to save the Indians.
Ovando complained that the negroes fled and
hid themselves among the natives, over whom they
exercised an unwholesome influence; nevertheless in
September, 1505, we find the king sending over more
African slaves to work in the mines, this time about
one hundred. From 1517, when importations from
the Portuguese establishments on the Guinea coast
were authorized by Charles V., the traffic increased,
and under the English, particularly, assumed enormous
proportions. This unhappy confusion of races led to
a negro insurrection at Española in 1522.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_262' href='#Page_262'>262</a></span>
</p>

<p>
We come now to some of the results of the temporizing
policy of Spain—always a bad one when the
subject is beyond the reach of the ruling arm—in
regard to the Indians. For out of a desire to avoid
the odium of Indian slavery, and yet secure the benefits
thereof, grew a system of servitude embodying all
the worst features of absolute bondage, with none of
its mitigations.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">REPARTIMIENTOS AND ENCOMIENDAS.</div>

<p>
It will be remembered that during his second voyage
Columbus made war on the natives of Española,
and after sending some as slaves to Spain, imposed a
tribute on the rest; on some a bell-measure of gold,
and on others an <i>arroba</i><a id='FA_V-6' href='#FN_V-6' class='fnanchor'>[V-6]</a> of cotton, every three months.
So severe was this tax that many could not meet it,
and in 1496 service was accepted in place of tribute.
This was the beginning in the New World of the
<i>repartimiento</i>,<a id='FA_V-7' href='#FN_V-7' class='fnanchor'>[V-7]</a> or as it shortly afterward became the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_263' href='#Page_263'>263</a></span>
<i>encomienda</i>, system, under which the natives of a conquered
country were divided among the conquerors,
recommended to their care, and made tributary to
them.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_264' href='#Page_264'>264</a></span>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">ADMINISTRATION OF THE INDIES.</div>

<p>
The theory was that the Indians were the vassals
of Spain, no more to be imposed upon than other
Spanish subjects. The sovereigns wishing to stimulate
discovery, pacification, and settlement, were willing
to waive their right to the tribute due the crown in
favor of enterprising and meritorious persons, who had
taken upon themselves the hardships incident to life in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_265' href='#Page_265'>265</a></span>
a new country. At first in certain instances, but later
to an extent which became general, they settled this
tribute upon worthy individuals among the conquerors
and colonists and their descendants, on condition that
those who thus directly received a portion of the
royal revenue should act the part of royalty to the
people placed temporarily in their care. They were
to be as a sovereign lord and father, and not as a
merciless or unjust taskmaster. They were to teach
their wards the arts of civilization, instruct them in
the Christian doctrine, watch over and guide and
guard them, and never to restrict them in the use
of their liberties, nor impose burdens on them, nor
in any way to injure or permit injury to befall them.
And for this protection they were neither to demand
nor receive more than the legal tribute fixed by the
royal officers, and always such as the natives could
without distress or discomfort pay. What the system
was in practice we shall have ample opportunity of
judging as we proceed in this history. Suffice it to
say here that to the fatherly-protection part of their
compact the colonists paid little heed, but evaded the
law in many ways, and ground the poor savages under
their iron heel, while the crown by ordering, and
threatening, earnestly but vainly sought to carry
out in good faith and humanity what they deemed a
sacred trust.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PARTITION SYSTEM.</div>

<p>
First, repartimientos of lands were authorized by
the sovereigns. This was in 1497, and nothing was
then said about the natives. But after dividing the
land it was but a step to the dividing of the inhabitants.
With the shipment of six hundred slaves in
1498, and an offer to their Majesties of as many more
as they could find sale for, Columbus wrote asking
permission to enforce the services of the natives until
settlement should be fairly begun, say for a year
or two; but without waiting for a reply he at once
began the practice, which introduced a new feature
into repartimientos. Then to all who chose to take
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_266' href='#Page_266'>266</a></span>
them, to Roldan and his followers, to the worst characters
on the island, among whom were the late
occupants of Spanish prisons, the vilest of humankind,
was given absolute dominion over these helpless
and innocent creatures. Having paid nothing for
them, having no pecuniary interest in them, they had
no object in caring whether they were fed or starved,
whether they lived or died, for if they died there were
more at hand upon the original terms.
</p>

<p>
Under Bobadilla the infamy assumed bolder proportions.
Columbus had apportioned to certain lands
certain natives to labor for the benefit of Spaniards,
but they worked under their cacique. Natives were
forced by Spaniards to work mines, but only under
special monthly license. Bobadilla not only permitted
the exaction from the natives of mining and
farming labor, but all restrictions were laid aside, and
from working their own soil they became mere labor-gangs
to be driven anywhere. Before sailing for the
New World Ovando had been charged by the sovereigns
with the exercise of extreme moderation in
levying tributes and making repartimientos. Those
who came with him not only failed in mining, but
neglected to plant, as did likewise the natives, thinking
thereby the quicker to rid themselves of the
invaders. Hence famine, engendering new diseases,
was at hand for both white men and red. Then the
Indians were systematically parcelled among the Spaniards,
to one fifty, to another one hundred, and the repartimiento
unfolded into the encomienda. Columbus
and Bobadilla had each endeavored to fasten Indian
slavery upon the New World, but this legalizing by
Ovando what had been illegally done by them, was
the heaviest blow in that direction. "To you is given
an encomienda of Indians with their chief; and you
are to teach them the things of our holy Catholic
faith," was the thin subterfuge by which this foul act
was accomplished.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE KING'S STRONG BOX.</div>

<p>
In 1508 was sent to Santo Domingo as treasurer-general
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_267' href='#Page_267'>267</a></span>
Miguel de Pasamonte to supersede Bernardino
de Santa Clara, who had received the office of
treasurer from Ovando. Santa Clara loved display
and lacked honesty. Using freely the king's money
he bought estates, and gave feasts, in one of which
the salt-cellars were filled with gold-dust. This folly
reaching the king's ears, Gil Gonzalez Dávila, of whom
we shall know more presently, was sent to investigate
the matter, and found Santa Clara a defaulter
to the extent of eighty thousand pesos de oro. His
property was seized and offered at auction. Ovando,
with whom Santa Clara was a favorite, stood by at
the sale, and holding up a pineapple offered it to the
most liberal bidder, which pleasantry was so stimulating
that the estate brought ninety-six thousand pesos
de oro, more than twice its value. Afterward the
plan was adopted of having three locks upon the government's
strong-box, the keys to which were carried
by the three chief treasury officials.<a id='FA_V-8' href='#FN_V-8' class='fnanchor'>[V-8]</a> Pasamonte was
an Aragonese, in the immediate service of Ferdinand,
with whom he corresponded in cipher during his
residence in the Indies. A very good repartimiento
of Indians was ordered by the king to be given the
faithful Pasamonte. In 1511 Gil Gonzalez Dávila
was made contador of Española, and Juan de Ampues
factor; to each were given two hundred Indians,
and they were ordered to examine the accounts of the
treasurer, Pasamonte. For the faithful must be kept
faithful by the strictest watching; such was Spanish
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_268' href='#Page_268'>268</a></span>
discretion, whether in the management of men or
women.
</p>

<p class="p2">
The removal of Ovando was delayed by the death
of Isabella in 1504, and of Columbus in 1506. After
persistent importunities Diego Colon, son of the admiral,
was permitted in 1508 to plead in the courts
of Spain his claim, as his father's successor, to the
viceroyalty of the Indies. His marriage, meanwhile,
with María de Toledo, a lady of high birth and connection,
assisted in opening the eyes of the law to
the justness of his demands, fully as much as did
any argument of counsel. Ovando was recalled and
Diego authorized to take his place.
</p>

<p>
The new governor, accompanied by his wife, his
brother Fernando, his uncles Bartolomé and Diego,
and a retinue brilliant with rank and beauty, landed
at Santo Domingo in July, 1509. Although Ferdinand
had withheld the title of viceroy, Diego evidently
regarded his appointment nothing less than a
viceroyalty, although the two mainland governors,
Alonso de Ojeda and Diego de Nicuesa, for the provinces
east and west of Urabá, remained independent
of him.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SOVEREIGN TRIBUNAL.</div>

<p>
Diego's administration was but little if any improvement
on those of his predecessors. He possessed
neither the ability nor the prudence of Ovando. He
had intended equity and honesty in his rulings, and
exceptional kindness to the natives; notwithstanding
which he began by granting repartimientos to himself,
his wife, and kindred, and giving the best of the
remainder to his favorites. So that the now standard
evils of favoritism and cruelty were in no wise mitigated.
Not only were the Indians no better used
than formerly, but falling into the errors of his father
in the management of men Diego's weak government
soon found opposed to it a faction at whose head was
the powerful Pasamonte. Charges of a serious nature
against the son of the Genoese so frequently reached
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_269' href='#Page_269'>269</a></span>
Spain that in 1511 the king found it necessary to establish
at Santo Domingo a sovereign tribunal to which
appeals might be made from the decisions of the governor.
This tribunal which at first was only a royal
court of law, superior to any other colonial power, was
the germ of the Real Audiencia of Santo Domingo
by which the greater part of the Indies, islands and
firm land, were governed for a period subsequent
to 1521. It was at first composed of three <i>jueces de
apelacion</i>, or judges of appeal, Marcelo de Villalobos,
Juan Ortiz de Matienzo, and Lúcas Vazquez de Aillon.
These <i>licenciados</i>, having brought with them
instructions from Spain, and also orders on Diego
Colon for partitions of land and two hundred Indians
each, in 1511 were ready to rule. They were empowered
to hear and determine appeals from the governor,
his <i>tenientes</i> and <i>alcaldes mayores</i>, and from any
other judges that had been or should be appointed
either by the colonial governor or by the crown,
appeal from their decision being only to the Council
of the Indies in Spain. Although from its creation
clothed with many of the powers of an audiencia, it
did not all at once possess that title, but gradually
assumed it.<a id='FA_V-9' href='#FN_V-9' class='fnanchor'>[V-9]</a> By decree of September 14, 1526, we
find the emperor ordering that in the city of Santo
Domingo there should reside the <i>Audiencia y Chancillería
Real</i>, "como está fundada," as at present
constituted. It was to consist of a president; four
<i>oidores</i>, who were also <i>alcaldes del crímen</i>, or criminal
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_270' href='#Page_270'>270</a></span>
judges; a <i>fiscal</i>, a prosecuting officer in this case; an
<i>alguacil mayor</i>, or high sheriff; a <i>teniente de gran canciller</i>,
or deputy grand chancellor, and other necessary
officers. Indeed, beside some of the other officers, a
president had already been provided in 1521, in the
person of Luis de Figueroa, bishop of Concepcion.
Francisco de Prado was appointed fiscal in 1523, at
which time the salaries of the oidores were raised,
as they had been deprived of the right of holding
Indians. All appeals from the <i>jueces de residencia</i>,
where the amount involved was less than six hundred
pesos de oro, were thereafter referred to this tribunal.
Alonso de Zuazo took his seat among the oidores
in 1526. To the audiencia of Santo Domingo was
given for its district the West India Islands; and on
the mainland the governments of Venezuela, Nueva
Andalucía, Rio de Hacha, and Guayana, or el Dorado,
this district being bounded by those of the audiencias
of the Nuevo Reino de Granada, Tierra Firme, Guatemala,
Nueva España, and the provinces of Florida.
The president was empowered to make such ordinances
as he should deem essential to the good government
and defence of the island, just as was done,
within their jurisdiction, by other governors of Indian
provinces. He might fill vacancies in the various
subordinate offices until the pleasure of the king
should be known, and he might do generally all
things pertaining to the executive power. In these
matters the oidores were forbidden to interfere; nor
could the president exercise judicial functions, but
must nevertheless sign with the judges all sentences.
In other respects this tribunal was on an equal footing
with others of its class.<a id='FA_V-10' href='#FN_V-10' class='fnanchor'>[V-10]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_271' href='#Page_271'>271</a></span>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">AUDIENCIAS.</div>

<p>
Meanwhile the most disturbing question in the colony
was that of labor. To govern the few Spaniards
at Española, under the arbitrary system of Spain, was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_272' href='#Page_272'>272</a></span>
a small matter; but to divide among them lands, agricultural
and mineral, and laborers in such a way as to
satisfy at once the colonists and the many tender and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_273' href='#Page_273'>273</a></span>
enlightened consciences in Spain, in such a way as to
prevent the utter ruin either of colonial enterprise or
of the natives themselves, was indeed a difficult task.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">END OF DIEGO COLON.</div>

<p>
In 1509 possession had been taken of Jamaica by
Juan de Esquivel, and toward the end of 1511<a id='FA_V-11' href='#FN_V-11' class='fnanchor'>[V-11]</a> the
governor of Española had sent Diego Velazquez to
occupy Cuba, which was done without the loss of a
Spaniard. Ojeda and Nicuesa having failed in colonizing
Darien, the mainland in that vicinity was
offered by the king in 1514 to the adelantado, Bartolomé
Colon, but he was then too ill to accept the
charge, and died not long after. In April, 1515,
Diego Colon embarked for Spain; and we find him
attempting his vindication at court, when Ferdinand
died, the 23d of January, 1516. Cardinal Jimenez,
who held the reins of Spanish government for a time,
refused to decide between the governor and treasurer;
but in 1520 the emperor directed Pasamonte to molest
Diego no more. Then affairs at Española became
more intolerable than ever, and in 1523 Diego was
divested of authority by the Council of the Indies,
the sovereign tribunal at Santo Domingo furnishing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_274' href='#Page_274'>274</a></span>
ample information of a condemnatory character. Diego
succeeded, however, in having a commission appointed
to examine the matter more carefully, but this tended
only to further complications; and the last days of the
son, which ended in 1526, were not more happy than
those of the father had been.<a id='FA_V-12' href='#FN_V-12' class='fnanchor'>[V-12]</a>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">BARTOLOMÉ DE LAS CASAS.</div>

<p class="p2">
A steadily growing character, impressing itself more
and more upon the affairs of the Indies as time went
by, was that of Bartolomé de las Casas. Born at
Seville in 1474, he conned his humanities at Salamanca,
making little stir among the Gamaliels there, but
taking the bachelor's degree in his eighteenth year.
After a residence of about eight years in the Indies,
having come with Ovando in 1502, he was admitted
to priestly orders, from which time he takes his place
in history. He was a man of very pronounced temperament
and faculties, as much man of business as
ecclesiastic, but more philanthropist than either; possessed
of a burning enthusiasm, when once the fire of
his conviction was fairly kindled, he gave rest neither
to himself nor to his enemies. For every evil-minded
man who came hither was his enemy, between whom
and himself was a death-struggle. The Apostle of
the Indies he was sometimes called, and the mission
he took upon himself was to stand between the naked
natives and their steel-clad tormentors. In this work
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_275' href='#Page_275'>275</a></span>
he was ardent, ofttimes imprudent, always eloquent
and truthful, and as impudently bold and brazen as
any cavalier among them all. Nor was he by any
means a discontented man. He sought nothing for
himself; he had nothing that man could take from
him except life, upon which he set no value, or except
some of its comforts, which were too poor at best to
trouble himself about. His cause, which was the
right, gave breadth and volume to his boldness, beside
which the courage of the hare-brained babbler was
sounding brass.
</p>

<p>
When the attention of the church was first seriously
drawn toward the amelioration of the condition
of the Indians, which was in 1511, there were at
Española some thirteen Dominicans, living with their
vicar, Pedro de Córdoba, according to the strictest
rules of the order, and likewise several Franciscans,
among whom was Antonio de Espinal. The Dominicans
began their protest by a sermon denouncing the
course of the colonists, and when ordered to retract,
they repeated their charges with still greater emphasis.
The colonists sent agents to Spain to have the
contumacious monks displaced, and among them Espinal;
for the Franciscans, as much in a spirit of
opposition to the Dominicans as to find favor with
the laity, showed a leaning toward the repartimiento
system, though they could not decently defend it.
The Dominicans sent Antonio Montesino, he who
had preached the distasteful sermon, all the Dominicans
present having signed approval of it. To consider
the matter, a junta was summoned in Spain,
which pronounced the Indians a free people, a people
to be Christianized, and not enslaved; they were innocent
heathen, not infidel enemies like the Moors, or
natural-born slaves like the negroes. Ferdinand and
Fonseca were both earnest in obtaining this verdict,
for so had said the king's preachers. Meanwhile
Montesino encountering Espinal in Spain, won him
over to the side of humanity. But all the same the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_276' href='#Page_276'>276</a></span>
repartimientos were continued, for they were fatherly
protection only in theory, and the colonists went on
scourging the poor red men.
</p>

<p>
In the occupation of Cuba, Pánfilo de Narvaez was
named by Velazquez his lieutenant, and sent forth to
subjugate other parts of the island. With Narvaez
went Las Casas, who put forth almost superhuman
exertions in vain to stay the merciless slaughter of
the helpless and innocent. A warm friend of Las
Casas was Velazquez' alcalde, Pedro de Rentería,
who in the division of the spoils joined Las Casas
in accepting a large tract of land, and a proportionate
repartimiento of Indians. This was before
Las Casas had seriously considered the matter, and
he was at first quite delighted with his acquisition.
But the enormity of the wrong coming upon him, his
conversion was as decisive as that of St Paul. Like
the Dominicans of Española, Las Casas began by
preaching against repartimientos. In 1515 he sailed
for Spain in company with Montesino, leaving his
charge with certain monks sent over from Española
by the prelate Córdoba. These Dominican brothers
did what they could, but to such straits were the savages
driven after the departure of Las Casas that to
escape the bloodhounds and other evils set upon them
by the Spaniards thousands of them took refuge in
suicide. When Diego Colon arrived in 1509 there
were left in Española forty thousand natives. A <i>repartidor</i>
was appointed in the person of Rodrigo de
Alburquerque to repartition the Indians, but when he
arrived in 1514 there were but thirteen thousand left
to divide. After proclaiming himself with great pomp,
Alburquerque plainly intimated that bribery was in
order, that he who paid the most money should have
the best repartimiento. Afterward the Licentiate
Ibarra, sent to Española to take the residencia of the
alcalde Aguilar, was authorized to make a new partition.
Large numbers of natives were given to the
king's favorites in Spain, and the evil grew apace.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_277' href='#Page_277'>277</a></span>
Nor were affairs at Española mended by sending out
so frequently new officials with new and conflicting
powers.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE JERONIMITE FATHERS.</div>

<p>
Whatever hopes the monks may have derived from
Ferdinand's benign reception, death cut short the
proposed relief. Fonseca, now bishop of Búrgos,
with coarse ribaldry dismissed the subject; but when
Las Casas applied to the regent, Cardinal Jimenez,
an earnest and active interest was manifest. Las
Casas, Montesino, and Palacios Rubios were directed
to present a plan for the government of the
Indies, which resulted in sending thither three Jeronimite
Fathers, Luis de Figueroa, Alonso de Santo
Domingo, and Bernardino Manzanedo, monks of the
order of St Jerome, being selected because they were
free from the complications in which those of St
Francis and St Dominic already found themselves
involved in the New World. The Jeronimites were
ordered to visit the several islands and inform themselves
regarding the condition of the Indians, and
adopt measures for the formation of native settlements.
These settlements or communities were to
be governed each by a cacique, together with an
ecclesiastic; and for every two or three settlements
a civil officer, called an administrator, having supreme
power in the settlements, was to be appointed. The
cacique, after obtaining the consent of the ecclesiastic,
should inflict no higher punishment on his subjects
than stripes; none should be capitally punished except
under regular process of law. The matters of education,
labor, tribute, mining, and farming were then
treated, in all which the welfare of the natives was
carefully considered, although the repartimiento system
remained. Las Casas was named Protector of
the Indians with a salary of one hundred pesos de oro.
Zuazo, a lawyer of repute, was sent with the most
ample powers to take a residencia of all the judges
in the New World, and against his decisions there
was to be no appeal.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_278' href='#Page_278'>278</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The Jeronimites set out wrapped in mighty determinations.
They would not even sail in the same
ship with Las Casas, wishing to be wholly free. In
this they were right; but unfortunately, on arriving
among the wrangling colonists, and having the
actual issues thrust upon them, they found themselves
by no means infallible. Their measures were
tame, and they soon found the Protector arrayed
against them. The result was their open defence of
the repartimiento system, as the only one by which
Spain could colonize the Indies. The burden should
be laid as lightly as possible on the shoulders of the
natives, but they must be made to work. Las Casas
set out in 1517 to enter his complaints at court,
closely followed by an emissary of the Jeronimites to
represent their side of the question; but they arrived
in Spain only to find the regent dying. Had Charles
V. remained in Flanders, and had the life of Cardinal
Jimenez been spared to Spain and the New World a
few years longer, it is certain that the cruelties to the
Indians would many of them have been prevented,
and it is doubtful if negro slavery would ever have
been introduced into America.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">DIVERS RULES AND RULERS.</div>

<p class="p2">
Though the change of rulers which now occurred
seriously clogged the wheels of government in Spain,
the affairs of the Indies seemed directly to suffer
little inconvenience therefrom. It was indeed a great
change, Isabella and Ferdinand gone, Columbus and
Jimenez also; and the presence of this young Charles,
undemonstrative, thoughtful, cautious, even when a
boy, and enveloped in a Flemish atmosphere that
shut out all that was most beautiful in Spain, even
Castile's liquid language, made it seem strange there
even to Spaniards, made it seem a long, long time
since the Moors were beaten and America discovered.
The Indies, however, were far away, and so little
understood by the Flemings that they did not trouble
themselves much about them.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_279' href='#Page_279'>279</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Las Casas was fortunate in winning the favor of
the Flemish chancellor, Selvagius, but as in the two
previous cases, scarcely was the friendly footing established
when the great man died, and the bishop of
Búrgos, whose influence in the government of the
Indies had fallen low of late, was again elevated.
All the measures that Las Casas had proposed to
Selvagius fell to the ground—all save one, the only
bad one, and one concerning which Las Casas afterward
asserted that he would give all he possessed
on earth to recall it; it was the introduction of negro
slaves to relieve the Indians.
</p>

<p>
If the Jeronimite Fathers accomplished no great
things in the Indies, they at least did little harm.
Small-pox attended the herding of the natives in
settlements, but it never prevailed to the extent
represented. The fact that Fonseca held an encomienda
of eight hundred Indians, the Comendador
Conchillos one of eleven hundred, Vega one of two
hundred, and other influential men at court other
numbers, may have had something to do with the
hostility manifested in that quarter toward Las Casas,
who was unflinching to the end in denouncing the
system as unjust, unchristian, and inhuman.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">CASA DE CONTRATACION.</div>

<p class="p2">
The office of Indian distributor was most important,
and one in which the vital interests of the
colonists were involved. It should have been filled
by one of high integrity who would hold aloof from
contaminating influences. Such was not Ibarra, who
became offensively meddlesome in the affairs of the
common council, and died under suspicious circumstances
not long after, Lebron being sent out to take
his place. When the Jeronimites countenanced negro
slavery to relieve the Indians, the colonists were benignant;
when they undertook civil service reform,
some of them became furious, especially Pasamonte,
who had been enriching himself as fast as possible
while his patron lived, but who had now sunk into
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_280' href='#Page_280'>280</a></span>
insignificance. The favorites of the Flemish ministers,
such as Rodrigo de Figueroa, to whom was
given charge of the Indian settlements, were now the
recipients of the fat offices; and the fact of their
being Flemish favorites was sufficient to array the
colonists against them. It was not long before they
succeeded in having the residencia of Figueroa ordered,
and Lebron installed as overseer of Indians in
his place. In 1518, Jimenez who sent the Jeronimites
being dead and Fonseca once more manager,
the monks were recalled to Spain, and the affairs of
Española and of the Indies were left with the audiencia
of Santo Domingo, acting in conjunction with
the <i>Consejo de Indias</i><a id='FA_V-13' href='#FN_V-13' class='fnanchor'>[V-13]</a> in Spain, the <i>Casa de Contratacion</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_281' href='#Page_281'>281</a></span>
having more especial charge of commercial
matters.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_282' href='#Page_282'>282</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Many schemes for the benefit of the Indians filled
the mind of Las Casas, who continued to labor for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_283' href='#Page_283'>283</a></span>
them indefatigably. One, originating with Pedro de
Córdoba, was to set apart on the mainland one hundred
leagues as a place of refuge for the savages, into
which no Spaniards but priests might enter. This
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_284' href='#Page_284'>284</a></span>
measure was opposed by Fonseca, who said: "The
king would do well, indeed, to give away a hundred
leagues without any profit to himself." After this
Las Casas spent some time travelling through Spain
and inducing Spaniards to emigrate to the Indies,
but little that was beneficial came of it. Succeeding
finally in enlisting the sympathies of the king's preachers
in behalf of the Indians, a plan for founding a
colony on the Pearl Coast was carried, and notwithstanding
Oviedo appeared in opposition to his brother
chronicler by offering a larger royalty, a grant of two
hundred and sixty leagues was signed in May, 1520.
Failing as a colonist, Las Casas retired for a time to
the Dominican convent at Santo Domingo. After
many years spent as missionary and preacher in Nicaragua,
Guatemala, Mexico, and Peru, he was appointed
bishop of Chiapas, where in the progress of this history
we shall again meet him.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">SUNDRY PROVISIONS.</div>

<p>
Certain attention which the Indies were now receiving
may be mentioned here. Some little attention
was paid by the ever-watchful government to the
welfare of society in these distant parts. The wearing
of rich apparel in Española was forbidden by the king
in 1523. The appellations of certain of the islands
were undergoing change, so that in due time their
aboriginal names were restored to Cuba and Jamaica,
the authorities thereby evincing a good taste which
rulers and explorers of other nations might well have
profited by at a later period. In 1515 six loaves of
sugar and twenty <i>cassia fistula</i> were taken by Oviedo
to Spain. In 1517 the pope made bishops in the
Indies inquisitors; and when in 1521-2 the bulls of
Leo X. and Adrian VI. ordered the Franciscans to
prepare for mission work in the New World, liberal
concessions were made to friars going thence. After
the death of Pedro de Córdoba, who had been appointed
inquisitor of the Indies, authority became
vested in the audiencia of Santo Domingo. Desirous
of stimulating emigration, the emperor in 1522 granted
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_285' href='#Page_285'>285</a></span>
further privileges to settlers in the Indies. Colonists
were ordered to take their families to the New World
under severe penalties for neglect. Licenses were revised,
and regulations concerning the going to the New
World of the religious orders as well as of all others
were made to the utmost extent favorable, but friars
found in the New World without a license must be
sent forthwith to Spain. Then laws were made attempting
to regulate the method of making war on
Indians; and in 1523 it was decreed that idols should
be destroyed and cannibalism prevented. Provision
was made for the annual payment of thirty thousand
maravedís for the support of a preceptor of grammar.
And because of the heavy expenses of living, the
emperor permitted the salaries of New World officials
to be increased. The tribunals were likewise reorganized
to fit the emergency and facilitate business.
Directions were issued how gold chains should be made
and dye-woods cut. It seemed to the emperor necessary
in 1526 to issue orders facilitating the arrest of
dishonest mercantile agents in the Indies, and to send
Padre de Bobadilla, a provincial of the order of La
Merced, to look after the baptism of the Indians.
And as to the question of negroes, vexatious from the
beginning, the emperor in 1523 revoked for a time
the permission given in 1511 to send negroes as slaves
to the Indies; and it was again ordered in 1526 that
Indian slaves then in Spain should be returned to
their country and treated as vassals.<a id='FA_V-14' href='#FN_V-14' class='fnanchor'>[V-14]</a>

<p>
The voyages of Bastidas and Columbus completed
the discovery of a continuous coast line from the gulf
of Paria to Cape Honduras. In 1506 Juan Diaz de
Solis, a native of Lebrija, and Vicente Yañez Pinzon
took up the line of discovery at the island of Guanaja,
where the admiral had first touched, and proceeding
in the opposite direction sailed along the coast of Honduras
to the westward, surveyed the gulf of Honduras
and discovered Amatique Bay, but passed by without
perceiving the Golfo Dulce which lies hidden from
the sea. The object still was to find the much-desired
passage by water to the westward. Continuing
northerly along Yucatan, and finding the coast trending
east rather than west, they abandoned the undertaking
and returned to Spain. Meanwhile Juan
Ponce de Leon was enriching himself by the pacification
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_290' href='#Page_290'>290</a></span>
of Puerto Rico, preparatory to invading the
mainland to the northward in search of the fountain
of youth; in which sapient attempt he lost his
money, and not long afterward his life, unfortunately
never finding the liquid immortality that bubbled
somewhere in the jungles of Florida.
</p>

<p>
And now ten years had elapsed since Cabot and
Columbus first saw the western continent, the former
in 1497, the latter in 1498, and although several
attempts had been made, as yet there was no European
settlement on any part of it. It was not that
the thirst for western spoils was by any means assuaged;
but Ferdinand was busy, and the experiences
of Ojeda and Columbus on the mainland were not
encouraging to the most chivalrous cupidity. Returned,
however, from his Neapolitan wars in 1507,
his disaffected nobles somewhat quieted, and the disputes
attending Isabella's succession allayed, the king
began to look about him. By the queen's testament
he inherited one half the revenues of the Castilian
colonies. And the king wanted money. It is a royal
weakness. Then he remembered what Columbus had
reported of the rich coast of Veragua; and although
the licenses hitherto granted for private voyages had
not proved very lucrative, and expenditures at Santo
Domingo were too near receipts to be satisfactory, no
better way seemed feasible than to throw open to colonization
the mainland, or <i>tierra firme</i>, as the discovered
portion of the continent now began to be called.<a id='FA_VI-1' href='#FN_VI-1' class='fnanchor'>[VI-1]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_291' href='#Page_291'>291</a></span>
Further than this, Ferdinand was well aware that if he
would retain his western possessions he must occupy
them; for stimulated by the success of Portugal and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_292' href='#Page_292'>292</a></span>
Spain, France, England, Holland, and Sweden had all
awakened to oceanic enterprise. He had before this
commissioned Ojeda to watch the inroads of the English
at the north, and directed Pinzon to have an
eye on the Portuguese and the pope's partition line
at the south; now he was resolved to break the territory
into kingdoms and provinces, and apportion them
for government to such of his subjects as were able
and willing to colonize at their own cost.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">OJEDA AND NICUESA.</div>

<p>
When the intention of the king was known, two
dashing cavaliers appeared and asked for the government
of the rich coast of the Tierra Firme. One
was Diego de Nicuesa, a native of Baeza, well-born
and an accomplished courtier, having been reared by
Enrique Enriquez, chief steward and uncle of the
king. He came to the Indies first with Ovando.
The other was Alonso de Ojeda, then in Santo Domingo,
and already famous in New World annals,
making his first appearance there with Columbus in
his second voyage, and having already achieved two
notable voyages to Paria, or the Pearl Coast, one in
1499 with Juan de la Cosa and Amerigo Vespucci,
and one in 1502, with García de Ocampo and Juan de
Vergara. The last had been made in four ships, and
for the purpose of colonizing; instead of which disputes
arose, and the fiery commander was seized and
carried in shackles to Española. There he was tried,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_293' href='#Page_293'>293</a></span>
and a decision rendered against him, which however
was overruled on appeal to the Council of the Indies;
but he came out of his difficulties stripped of all his
possessions.
</p>

<p>
The candidates were much alike, each being a fair
type of the Spanish cavalier. Both were small in
stature, though none the less men of prowess. Symmetrical
in form, muscular, active, and skilful in
the use of weapons, they delighted in tilting matches,
feats of horsemanship, and in all those pastimes which
characterized Spanish chivalry at the close of the
Mahometan wars. The school in which Ojeda had
studied experience, as page to the duke of Medina
Celi, who appeared in the Moorish wars at the head
of a brilliant retinue, was in no wise inferior to that
of his rival. Their accomplishments were varied,
though not specially in the direction of colonizing
new countries. Not only was Nicuesa a fine musician,
playing well the guitar, and having some knowledge
of ballad literature, but he could make his horse
prance in perfect time to a musical instrument. As
for Ojeda, there was little, in his own opinion, he
could not do. The more of recklessness and folly in
the exploit the better he could perform it. Once at
Seville, while Isabella was in the cathedral tower, out
from which ran a beam, at a height so great that from
it men on the ground looked like pygmies, to show
the queen of what metal he was made, he mounted
this beam, balanced himself, then tripped lightly as a
rope-dancer to the end of it, wheeled, and lifting one
foot poised himself on the other at this fearfully dizzy
height, where almost a breath would dash him to
destruction; then, returning, he stopped at the wall
and placing one foot against it threw an orange to
the top of the tower.
</p>

<p>
With such distinguished ability on either side, it
was difficult to determine between them. Who so
suitable to baffle miasma, poisonous reptiles, and
wild beasts while dressing the institutions of Spain
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_294' href='#Page_294'>294</a></span>
for the wilderness of America, as the graceful and
witty Nicuesa! What a glorious missionary Ojeda
would make! So moderate, so wise, so gentle, so
just, both! Nicuesa had money, a necessary commodity
to him who would colonize at his own cost.
But then Ojeda had influence; for Fonseca was his
friend, and an inquisitor his cousin. Yet Nicuesa
was not without advocates at court; money alone was
a powerful argument. When, finally, the veteran
pilot, Juan de la Cosa, threw his experience and
earnings upon the side of Ojeda, to whom he was
devotedly attached, and offered himself to embark in
the adventure, the king concluded to let them both
go; and then it was that he divided Tierra Firme
between them, making the gulf of Urabá<a id='FA_VI-2' href='#FN_VI-2' class='fnanchor'>[VI-2]</a> the dividing
point. The eastern or South American portion
was called Nueva Andalucía, and of this Alonso de
Ojeda was appointed governor; the western division,
extending from the gulf of Urabá, or Darien, to Cape
Gracias á Dios, was named by the king Castilla del
Oro,<a id='FA_VI-3' href='#FN_VI-3' class='fnanchor'>[VI-3]</a> or Golden Castile, and the command given to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_295' href='#Page_295'>295</a></span>
Diego de Nicuesa. The island of Jamaica, whence
they expected to draw their supplies, was to be held
in common by the two governors. Were it not so
much more delightful to bargain with new suitors
who have money, than to reward old servants who
have none, a fine sense of decency might have prompted
the monarch to give Castilla del Oro to the adelantado,
Bartolomé Colon, who had assisted in discovering,
and in an attempt to colonize the country, and
who had little to show for his many and valuable
services to Spain. But Diego Colon was determined
they should not have Jamaica, and so sent thither
Juan de Esquivel, as we have seen, to hold it for the
governor of Santo Domingo.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">MAINLAND DIVISIONS.</div>

<p>
The mainland governors were each appointed for
four years, during which time supplies were free
from duties. Their outfit, with four hundred settlers
and two hundred miners each, might be obtained from
Santo Domingo. They were given the exclusive
right to work for ten years all mines discovered by
them on paying into the royal treasury for the first
year one tenth of the proceeds, the second year one
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_296' href='#Page_296'>296</a></span>
ninth, the third one eighth, the fourth one seventh,
the fifth one sixth, and for the remaining five years
one fifth. The king conditioned, moreover, that each
governor should build two forts for the protection of
the colonists, to whom the lands in the vicinity of
which were to belong.
</p>

<p>
It so happened that the doughty little governors
met at Santo Domingo, while making their final
preparations. Swelling with new dignities, active and
mettlesome, each desirous of obtaining as many recruits
as possible, it was not long before they came
into collision. First they quarrelled about Jamaica;
as a supplement to which Ojeda stoutly swore that
should he there encounter Juan de Esquivel, his
head should pay the penalty. Then their partition
line became a bone of contention, both claiming the
Indian province of Darien.<a id='FA_VI-4' href='#FN_VI-4' class='fnanchor'>[VI-4]</a> The geography of the
coast was at that time but little known; their dominions
toward the south were limitless, and for aught
they knew larger than Spain. Although both the
commanders were small corporally, in feeling they
were large, and required much room. The breach
thus opened was in no wise lessened by the superior
success of Nicuesa, who with a deeper purse, and a
government famous for its wealth, drew off recruits
from his less fortunate rival. Five large caravels
and two brigantines, flying the flag of Castilla del
Oro, rode in the harbor. All were well equipped
and liberally provisioned; and already Nicuesa mustered
nearly eight hundred men and six horses, while
Ojeda at his best could muster but three hundred
men in two small ships and two brigantines.<a id='FA_VI-5' href='#FN_VI-5' class='fnanchor'>[VI-5]</a>
</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_297' href='#Page_297'>297</a></span>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE RIVAL GOVERNORS.</div>

<p>
Nettled at every turn he made about the little
town, Ojeda, who was a better swordsman than logician,
at length proposed to settle all scores by single
combat. "Agreed," replied Nicuesa, who was equally
brave yet less passionate, "but for what shall we
fight? Match me with five thousand castellanos, and
I am your man." Finally old Juan de la Cosa interfered
to prevent bloodshed; the river Darien, or
Atrato, was made the dividing line, and measures
were taken to hasten departure before the fire of hot
Ojeda should blaze out again.
</p>

<p>
But Ojeda was not without his little triumphs.
There dwelt at this time at the capital of the Indies
a lawyer, known as the Bachiller<a id='FA_VI-6' href='#FN_VI-6' class='fnanchor'>[VI-6]</a> Martin Fernandez
de Enciso, who during a successful practice of many
years had accumulated some two thousand castellanos.
Tempted by the offer of being made alcalde mayor<a id='FA_VI-7' href='#FN_VI-7' class='fnanchor'>[VI-7]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_298' href='#Page_298'>298</a></span>
of the new government, he was induced by the
impetuous Ojeda to embark his entire fortune in
the adventure. It was arranged that the bachiller
should remain at Santo Domingo for some time after
the departure of Ojeda, in order to obtain further
recruits and fit out another ship, and then follow the
governor to Nueva Andalucía.
</p>

<p>
Of Ojeda's party was Francisco Pizarro; and flitting
restlessly from one heterogeneous group to
another, enviously watching preparations in which
circumstances prevented their participating, were
other dominant spirits waiting opportunity, notably
Vasco Nuñez de Balboa, tied by debt to distasteful
agriculture, and Hernan Cortés, fortunately forbidden
to embark by illness.
</p>

<p>
Ojeda was the first to sail, embarking November
10, 1509. Nicuesa would have weighed anchor at the
same time, but was prevented by his creditors; for
his success in securing followers was attended by so
copious a drain of purse that not only his money but
his credit was gone.
</p>

<p>
Favorable winds wafted Ojeda quickly to Cartagena,
where he landed and proclaimed in loud and
vaunting tones his manifesto.<a id='FA_VI-8' href='#FN_VI-8' class='fnanchor'>[VI-8]</a> A shower of poisoned
darts was the reply; a mark of disrespect from his
new subjects which set the governor's blood boiling.
Breathing a short prayer to the virgin, Ojeda seized
a lance, and charging the natives at the head of his
followers scattered them in the forest, and rashly pursued
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_299' href='#Page_299'>299</a></span>
them. These were no effeminate islanders; the
women fought side by side with the men, who were
equal to those of Veragua, with the additional advantage
of envenomed arrow-points, which, with the occasional
shelter their forests afforded, made them more
than a match for the Spaniards.<a id='FA_VI-9' href='#FN_VI-9' class='fnanchor'>[VI-9]</a> This Ojeda had all
to learn, and to pay dearly for the knowledge. Of
seventy of his best and bravest who followed him
four leagues inland but one returned. Even his
staunch and veteran friend, Juan de la Cosa, after
vainly attempting to dissuade his self-willed colleague
from his purpose, placed himself by his side and died
there. Ojeda fought like a tiger until his men were
scattered and killed, and he was left wounded and
alone in a marshy thicket, where several days after
a fresh party from the ships found him half-dead.
When warmed into life and returned to the harbor
he saw entering it Nicuesa's fleet he hid himself,
afraid to meet his rival in that plight. Told of
this by Ojeda's men, as supplemental to their dismal
tale, Nicuesa's anger was aroused at the unjust suspicion.
"Tell your commander," he exclaimed, "that
Diego de Nicuesa is a Christian cavalier who makes
no war on a prostrate foe; that not only shall past
feuds be buried, but he promises never to leave this
spot until the deaths of Juan de la Cosa and his comrades
are avenged." He was as good as his word.
Landing four hundred men, he surprised an Indian
village, put men, women, and children to the sword,
and secured large booty.

<p>
After Nicuesa had departed on his way, Ojeda cast
off from that ill-fated shore his ships, and brought
them to the gulf of Urabá, where on its eastern
side, near the entrance, he built a fortress, the beginning
of his capital city, and called it San Sebastian<a id='FA_VI-10' href='#FN_VI-10' class='fnanchor'>[VI-10]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_300' href='#Page_300'>300</a></span>
in honor of the arrow-martyred saint, whose protection
he craved from the venomous darts of his subjects.
From San Sebastian, Ojeda despatched to
Santo Domingo one of his vessels with the gold and
captives he had taken, at the same time urging Enciso
to hasten his departure, and send supplies. Meanwhile
Ojeda's temper, which was as sharp and fiery
as Damascus steel, made little head-way against tangled
marshes and poisoned arrows. Persisting in his
high-handed policy, he could do nothing with the
natives, food being as difficult to obtain as gold, and
his ranks rapidly thinned.
</p>

<p>
While harassed by hunger and watching anxiously
the coming of Enciso and the return of their ships,
the colonists descried one day a strange sail. On
reaching San Sebastian it proved to be a Genoese
vessel which, while loading with bacon and cassava
bread at Cape Tiburon, had been piratically seized
by one Bernardo de Talavera and a gang of vagabonds
from Santo Domingo, who escaped with their
prize and had come to Nueva Andalucía to seek
fortune under the wise and happy rule of Governor
Ojeda. To buy the cargo was the work of a
moment, for the pirates were very ready to sell; and,
indeed, had they not been, the governor would have
compelled them. The poison was in his blood, which
was now hot with fever, and he was in no mood for
ceremony. But the relief thus obtained was only
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_301' href='#Page_301'>301</a></span>
temporary. Day by day the food supply diminished.
The colonists were reduced in number from three
hundred to three score. And with bodily ailment
came as usual mind-distempers, wranglings, ruin,
and despair. Where now was the valiant Ojeda?
Humiliated to the dust, as well before the savages as
before the Spaniards.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEATH OF OJEDA.</div>

<p>
Yet he would not yield to fate without another
effort, wasted and weak as he was. Giving Pijano
command of the fortress, Ojeda took passage in the
freebooter's ship and sailed for Santo Domingo. But
his patroness, the virgin, had indeed deserted him.
Shipwreck met him at Cuba, whence he crossed to
Jamaica. Talavera and his gang, after the most extraordinary
exertions, likewise reached Jamaica, but
only to be seized by order of Diego Colon and hanged.
Ojeda said nothing to Esquivel about striking off his
head, but humbly took the kindly extended aid. Proceeding
to Española in a caravel he found Enciso
gone, and himself a bankrupt invalid. Pride, which
seldom deserts a Spanish cavalier, gave way. Reduced
to penury, broken-hearted, he died, begging as
proof of his humility to be buried under the monastery
portal, that all who entered should tread upon his
grave. Farewell, daring, dashing, irrational Ojeda!
</p>

<p>
Let us now look after Nicuesa. When from the
discomfited Ojeda the gallant governor of Castilla del
Oro last parted, he coasted westward toward Veragua,
where he purposed to plant his colony. The better
to survey the seaboard, he took a small caravel, and
ordered Lope de Olano, his lieutenant, to attend him
with two brigantines, while the larger vessels kept
farther from the shore. Thus they proceeded until
reaching the Indian province of Cueba, where a port
was discovered into which flowed a small stream called
Pito. There they landed and said mass,<a id='FA_VI-11' href='#FN_VI-11' class='fnanchor'>[VI-11]</a> and therefore
named the place Misas.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_302' href='#Page_302'>302</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Leaving there the largest ships in charge of a relative
named Cueto, who was to receive word when to
follow, Nicuesa pressed forward toward Veragua with
a caravel carrying sixty men, Lope de Olano still attending
in a brigantine with thirty men. A storm
arising not long after, the latter took advantage of
this and the darkness of the night to separate from
him, impelled partly by a conviction that they were
on the wrong course, partly by ambitious projects.
After waiting two days in vain for his companion
Nicuesa continued westward. In the search for Veragua
he attempted to follow a chart drawn by Bartolomé
Colon, though his pilots Diego de Ribero and
Diego Martin, both of whom had been with Columbus,
assured him that he had passed the place. The
storm increasing, Nicuesa ran his vessel into the
mouth of a large river; but when attempting to proceed
after the storm he found himself caught in a trap,
and his vessel on the bar amidst the breakers, the
water having subsided. Unable to move the ship in
either direction, its destruction was inevitable, and
the men set about saving themselves. A rope was
stretched to the shore at the cost of a life; and scarcely
had the last person reached land when the vessel went
to pieces.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">CASTILLA DEL ORO.</div>

<p>
Behold, then, the courtly Nicuesa, so lately the
proud commander of a fleet, by this sudden freak of
fortune cast upon an inhospitable shore, his whereabouts
unknown to himself or to those in the ships,
and his almost naked followers destitute of food, save
one barrel of flour and a cask of oil flung them by
the surly breakers! His mind was moreover ill at
ease concerning Olano, whose reputation was none of
the best, and who Nicuesa thought might have joined
him had he been disposed. The ship's boat fortunately
drifted ashore, and in it Nicuesa placed Diego
de Ribero and three seamen, ordering them to keep
him company along the shore, and render assistance
in crossing streams and inlets. Already faint with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_303' href='#Page_303'>303</a></span>
hunger, they began their march. But whither? Still
westward, but not toward Veragua. Each weary
footstep carried them farther and farther from their
destination. It was not a pleasant journey feeling
their way through tropical forests, with such impediments
as tangled jungles, hot malarious mudbeds,
craggy hills and treacherous streams to block their
way. Some of the party had no shoes, some no
hat; sharp stones cut their feet, thorny brambles tore
their flesh, and their half-clad bodies were exposed
alternately to burning sun and drenching rain. They
were soon glad to get shell-fish and roots to eat with
their leaves. One day an arrow from an overhanging
height struck dead Nicuesa's page, but fortunately
the savages retired without pressing their advantage.
Nicuesa's dog, seeing murder in his hungry master's
eye, took to his heels and was never afterward seen.
Yet greater misfortunes awaited the Spaniards. After
crossing an inlet in the boat one evening, they rested
for the night, and in attempting to resume their
march next morning found themselves upon an island.
Calling for Ribero, he was missing. Nor was the
boat anywhere to be seen. It could not be possible
that he had left them to die on that circumscribed
and barren spot. Loudly they called, searching every
inlet, and sweeping the horizon with terror-lighted
eyes. It was true; they were abandoned!
</p>

<p>
It is curious to witness the effect of despair on
different minds, of the near approach of that hateful
means for our final suppression. Some will fight the
monster; others succumb, sinking into drivelling imbecility;
others calmly abandon themselves to the
inevitable, even the ludicrous aspect of the case coming
home to some of them, looking grimly cheerful.
As elsewhere, both fools and philosophers were found
among Nicuesa's crew. Some prayed and confessed,
with divers degrees of accompaniment, from low lamentation
to frantic raving; some cursed; some nursed
their horror in sullen silence.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_304' href='#Page_304'>304</a></span>
</p>

<p>
I shall not attempt to describe Nicuesa's sufferings
while on this island. Suffice it to say that
on a scanty diet of roots and shell-fish with brackish
water many died, while others wished themselves
dead; for the former might rot in peace, but the
latter yet living swarmed with impatient vermin.
And there was little satisfaction in effort, when
drinking only increased thirst, and eating but kept
alive despondency. Truly it was a good thing, a
grand thing to adventure life to capture wild lands
and rule one's fellows!
</p>

<p>
Thus weeks passed. Then like a ray shot from the
Redeemer's throne a sail was seen. Men wasted to
the last extremity shook off death's grip and roused
themselves, stretching their long lank necks, their bony
chins and glazed eyes toward the approaching vessel,
which soon came to anchor before the island. Ribero
was not a villain after all. Satisfied that Veragua
was behind them, but unable to convince Nicuesa,
Ribero won over to his views the three boatmen, left
the island during the night, retraced their course and
reached Veragua. There they found the colonists,
with Olano bearing rule, who on the information of
Ribero could scarcely do less than send his governor
succor.<a id='FA_VI-12' href='#FN_VI-12' class='fnanchor'>[VI-12]</a>
</p>

<p class="p2">
Leaving here Nicuesa, let us inquire concerning
the other portions of his scattered colony. Two
months having elapsed since the departure of the
governor from the port of Misas, and hearing nothing
from any one, Cueto, in whose charge the fleet was
left, became uneasy, and taking a small vessel, set out
in search of his commander. The only tidings he
could gain were from a letter found on an island,
wrapped in a leaf and fastened to a stick, which informed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_305' href='#Page_305'>305</a></span>
him that Nicuesa was well and still journeying
westward. Returning to Misas, Cueto with the
entire fleet sailed for Veragua; but so badly worm-eaten
were the ships that he was obliged to come to
anchor at the mouth of the River Chagre,<a id='FA_VI-13' href='#FN_VI-13' class='fnanchor'>[VI-13]</a> which
from the ravenous alligators that swarmed there was
called by the Spaniards Lagartos. There portions
of the cargoes were landed; and while attempts were
made to repair the ships, one of the pilots, Pedro de
Umbría, was sent in quest of the lost governor.
Meanwhile Lope de Olano arrived.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">WOES OF NICUESA.</div>

<p>
Evidently the lieutenant did not in his heart
desire his captain's return. For although in reciting
to his comrades the circumstances of the storm,
and the disappearance of the governor, with such
variations as suited his purpose, with tears which
would have done honor to the crocodiles thereabout,
he made no effort to find Nicuesa. He affected to
believe him dead. "And now, gentlemen," he said,
"let no more mention be made of him if you would
not kill me."
</p>

<p>
The fleet now proceeded to Belen, where the usual
catalogue of disasters attends the disembarkation.
Four men are drowned. The worm-eaten ships are
dismantled, broken in pieces, and of the fragments
huts are made on the site formerly occupied by
Bartolomé Colon. Olano, after some opposition, is
formally proclaimed lieutenant-governor. Raids follow;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_306' href='#Page_306'>306</a></span>
but the quibian, grown wise by experience, retires
with his people, and leaves the Spaniards to
shift for themselves. There being nothing to steal,
they starve. Disease and disaffection follow; Olano
is not happy.
</p>

<p>
Wrathful, indeed, was Nicuesa on reaching Belen.
Against Olano his indignation was extreme. He
charged him with wilful desertion, with felonious
destruction of the ships, and with gross mismanagement.
He had ruined all. Branding him as a traitor
he ordered his arrest; and when some feeble attempts
were made by the others to mitigate the governor's
displeasure, he broke forth on them. "It well becomes
you," he exclaimed, "to ask pardon for him,
when you should be begging mercy for yourselves!"
</p>

<p>
But of what use were oaths and bickerings? Of
his gallant company half were dead, and the less
fortunate remainder lived only to suffer yet awhile
before following. Of all the men who came from
Spain, proud Nicuesa lost the most, having most
to lose. Of all New World woes, Nicuesa's woes
were greatest; the half of what thus far has been
words cannot tell, and the worst part is yet to come.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">NOMBRE DE DIOS.</div>

<p>
Now that the rich Veragua was reached, the Golden
Castile of greedy anticipations, what then? The gold
with which to load the ships was wanting; the ships
with which to bear away that gold were almost all
destroyed. The fertile soil was marshy, the spicy air
malarious, the redundant vegetation yielded little food
for man. Sallow-faced skeletons of men clamored
their distress. Death was busy enough, so Olano's
life was spared, though his badge of office was exchanged
for fetters. Even foragers perished for want
of food; every member of one band died from eating
of a putrescent Indian. The governor grew peevish;
his generous temper was soured by misfortune. The
colonists complained of his harsh treatment and indifference
to their sufferings. And they said to him:
"The fates are against us here; let us abandon this
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_307' href='#Page_307'>307</a></span>
place." "Oh, very well!" snarled Nicuesa. Leaving
Alonso Nuñez, with the dignified title of alcalde
mayor, and a few men to harvest some grain planted
by Olano, the colonists embarked in two brigantines
and a caravel, built of fragments of the broken ships,
to seek some healthier spot. After sailing eastward
some twenty leagues, a Genoese sailor named Gregorio
addressed the governor: "I well remember, when
with the admiral in this vicinity we entered a fine
port where we found food and water." After some
search the place was found, the Portobello of Columbus,
and an anchor dropped there by the admiral
was seen protruding from the sand. Landing
for food, the Spaniards were attacked and twenty
killed; indeed, they could scarcely wield their weapons
so weak were they. Faint and disheartened they
continued their way about seven leagues farther,
when approaching the shore Nicuesa cried out: "Paremos
aquí en el nombre de Dios!" Here let us stop
in God's name! They found anchorage, the place
being the Puerto de Bastimentos of Columbus. The
companions of Nicuesa, however, ready in their distress
to seize on any auspice, took up the cry of their
commander and applied the words Nombre de Dios<a id='FA_VI-14' href='#FN_VI-14' class='fnanchor'>[VI-14]</a>
to the harbor which they then entered, and which
name to this day it bears.
</p>

<p>
Here another attempt was made to locate the government
of Castilla del Oro. Disembarking, Nicuesa
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_308' href='#Page_308'>308</a></span>
took formal possession, erected a fortress, and began
again his necessary though suicidal policy of foraging.
The natives retired. The malarious atmosphere
wrapped the strangers in disease and death. The
caravel was sent back to Veragua, and Alonso Nuñez
and the remnant of the colony brought away. The
vessel was then sent to Española for supplies, but
neither ship nor crew were ever afterward heard
from. Meanwhile Nicuesa and the remnant of his
luckless company made a brave stand, but all of no
avail. Long since fate had decreed their destruction.
It was not possible in their present condition
to live. Reptiles as food became a luxury to them;
the infected sunlight dried up their blood; despair
paralyzed heart and brain; and to so dire extremity
were they finally reduced that they were scarcely able
to mount guard or bury their dead.<a id='FA_VI-15' href='#FN_VI-15' class='fnanchor'>[VI-15]</a>
</p>

<p>
In my bibliographical notices thus far I have had occasion to make mention
more particularly of original documents referring to individual episodes.
I will now say a few words concerning the early chroniclers, Las Casas, Oviedo,
Peter Martyr, and Gomara, and of the later and more general writer, Herrera.
On these, the corner-stones of early Spanish American annals, the
fabrics of all who follow them must forever rest.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_309' href='#Page_309'>309</a></span>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE WRITINGS OF LAS CASAS.</div>

<p>
The lives of Las Casas and Oviedo constitute in themselves no small portions
of their respective histories. Both came to the New World, and each
took an active and prominent part in many of the matters of which he wrote.
They were nearly of an age; the former being born at Seville in 1474, and
the latter at Madrid in 1478; but Oviedo did not come to America until 1514,
being with Pedrarias Dávila when he went to govern Darien, while Las Casas
took up his residence under Ovando at Española in 1502. Las Casas was an
ecclesiastic whose life was devoted to befriending the Indians, and he did not
leave America for the last time until 1547, after half a century of most humane
service; Oviedo was a cavalier who sought to better his broken fortunes
by obtaining through his influence at court the office of <i>veedor de las fundiciones
del oro de la Tierra Firme</i>, supervisor of gold-melting for Tierra Firme,
which office he held throughout his connection with the affairs of the continental
Indies, until 1532. Both were influential men at court, Las Casas
being quite intimate with young Charles, while Oviedo had been <i>mozo de
cámara</i>, or page to Prince Juan. Both made frequent trips between Spain
and America; Oviedo crossed the Atlantic twelve times, Las Casas even more.
</p>

<p>
Las Casas was as able an annalist as he was reformer. His greatest work,
<i>Historia de las Indias</i>, was begun in his fifty-third year, and completed in
1561, five years before his death. It was extensively copied and used in
manuscript, but was not printed until 1875-76. Though consisting of five
volumes, it comprises but three decades, or books, and brings the history of
the New World down only to 1520. It was the author's original intention to
have continued his work through six decades, which would have brought it
down to 1550, and hence have included his important experiences in Guatemala,
Chiapas, and Mexico. Next to the general history of the Indies stands
the <i>Apologética Historia</i>, comprising a description of the country and the customs
of the people, and written to defend the natives against the accusation
that they lacked system in their societies, not having reason to govern themselves.
His first printed work was issued in Mexico in 1546; it was entitled
<i>Cancionero Spiritual</i>, and was dedicated to Bishop Zumárraga. At Seville, in
1552, was published, in one volume 4to, <i>Breve relacion de la destruccion de
las Indias Occidentales</i>, and other tracts of a similar nature; such as his Controversy
with Sepúlveda; his Thirty Propositions; Remedies for the Reformation
of Indies; Rules for Confessors; a treatise proving the sovereign empire
and universal authority which the kings of Castile and Leon have over the
Indies, etc. This collection was put in print in Latin, French, Italian, German,
and Dutch, some of the translations appearing in several editions. The
Controversy with Sepúlveda was issued separately. Juan Antonio Llorente
printed at Paris in 1822 a <i>Coleccion de las Obras del Obispo de Chiapa</i>, 2 vols.
8vo, which was published the same year in French, under title of <i>Œuvres de
Don Barthélemi de las Casas</i>. The collection comprises several of his less important
works; the French translation is remarkably free, the author being
at times quite lost sight of, and several new pieces of doubtful origin are
added. As a writer, Las Casas is honest, earnest, and reliable, except where
his enthusiasm gets the better of him. His learned opponent and arch-enemy,
Sepúlveda, pronounces him most subtle, most vigilant, and most
fluent, compared with whom the Ulysses of Homer was inert and stuttering.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_310' href='#Page_310'>310</a></span>
He was not only a thorn in the flesh of evil-doers, but by his persistent and
stinging effrontery he often exasperated mild and benevolent men. But whatever
his enemies may say of him, and they are neither few nor silent, true it
is that of all the men who came to the Indies he almost alone leaves the furnace
with no smell of fire upon him.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">GONZALO FERNANDEZ DE OVIEDO Y VALDÉS.</div>

<p>
Gonzalo Fernandez de Oviedo y Valdés was of the noble family of Oviedo
in Asturias. In early childhood, before entering the service of Prince Juan,
he was with the duke of Villa Hermosa. While watching the fall of Granada
he met Columbus, and afterward witnessed his triumph at Barcelona. After
the death of his young master in 1497, who in fact was of his own age, Oviedo
went to Italy, where art and science were enlivened by war, serving under
Frederico of Naples, and sometimes jewel-keeper to Queen Juana. Married
at Madrid, in 1502, to the beautiful Margarita de Vergara, whom he lost in
childbirth ten months after, he plunged into the excitement of war, serving
as secretary to Córdoba in the French campaign. Marrying again, he hovered
about the court until, in his thirty-sixth year, his dwindling fortunes
sent him with Pedrarias to Darien, in the capacity before mentioned. His
doings there will be told in the text of this history; suffice it to say here that
most of his time there was spent in broils with the governor, beside which
he had to endure the loss of his wife and child, imprisonment, and the dangerous
wound of an assassin's knife. But, obtaining at last the appointment
of Pedro de los Rios in place of Pedrarias, and for himself the governorship
of Cartagena, which office, however, he never exercised, after three years'
further residence in Tierra Firme, this time in Nicaragua, he returned to
Spain in 1530, spent two years in arranging his notes, resigned his <i>veeduría</i>,
and received the appointment of <i>Cronista general de Indias</i>. In the autumn
of 1532 he went to Santo Domingo, and although appointed the following
year alcalde of the fortress of Santo Domingo, the remainder of his life
was passed chiefly in literary work. After an eventful life of seventy-nine
years he died at Valladolid in 1557, while engaged in the preparation
for the press of the unpublished portion of his history. Throughout
the whole of his career Oviedo seems to have devoted every spare moment
to writing. Even before he was appointed royal chronicler he was an indefatigable
collector of material. He was well acquainted with the prominent
persons of his time, and few expeditions were made without adding to his
store. Want of discrimination in the use of authorities is more prominent in
his writings than want of authorities. Of twelve literary efforts but one,
beside those relating to America, found its way into print. He formed the
plan of writing about the New World long before he first crossed the ocean,
and actually began his history, according to José Amador de los Rios, before
1519, keeping open the general divisions for additions to the day of his death.
After his return from the second voyage to Darien he wrote at the request of
the king, and chiefly from memory, as his notes were at Santo Domingo, <i>De
la Natural Hystoria de las Indias</i>, printed at Toledo in 1526. This work was
republished by Barcia, <i>Historiadores Primitivos</i>, i., translated into Italian by
Ramusio, <i>Viaggi</i>, iii., and garbled by Purchas in <i>His Pilgrimes</i>, iv. 5. This, it
must be borne in mind, is totally distinct from the <i>Historia General y Natural
de las Indias, Islas y Tierra-Firme del Mar Océano, por el Capitan Gonzalo
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_311' href='#Page_311'>311</a></span>
Fernandez de Oviedo y Valdés, primer cronista del Nuevo Mundo</i>, and which
alone admits the author to the first rank as a historian. The General History
was originally divided into three parts, containing in all fifty books. The first
part, comprising nineteen books, with the preface and ten chapters of the fiftieth
book—not 20, 21, or 22 books as different bibliographers state—was published
during the author's life at Seville in 1535, under the title <i>Historia General</i>,
etc., and republished at Salamanca in 1547 as <i>Hystoria General</i>. This rare
issue contains in several places a few columns of additional matter which
have not escaped my attention. An Italian version of the same parts was
published by Ramusio in his <i>Viaggi</i>, iii.; the first ten books were translated
into French and published as <i>Histoire Naturelle</i>, etc., Paris, 1556; the
twentieth book, or the first of the second part, was published separately at
Valladolid in 1557 as <i>Libro XX.</i>, etc. Thirteen chapters of Book XLII., relating
to Nicaragua, were published in French by Ternaux-Compans, <i>Histoire
du Nicaragua</i>, in his second series of Voyages, iii., Paris, 1840. Finally, the
fifty books complete were beautifully and accurately printed at Madrid in
four folio volumes, with plates, by the Real Academia de la Historia in 1851-55.
The editor, José Amador de los Rios, gives in an introduction the best
notice of the life and writings of the author extant. Oviedo was not a learned
man like Peter Martyr, and it is doubtful if a further insight into the books
of the day would have made him any wiser; yet a man who could dictate
the natural history of a new country without his notes cannot be called illiterate.
He knew Latin and the modern languages; but his familiarity with
Latin was not sufficient to prevent an unpleasant parade of it. Nor did he
possess the genius or practical sagacity of Las Casas; yet his extraordinary
opportunities were not wholly wasted, nor did life at court, political quarrels,
or gold-gathering at any time wholly stifle his ambition to achieve the useful
in letters. Oviedo was a fair example of the higher type of Spaniard of that
day; he was intelligent, energetic, brave; but cold, unscrupulous, and cruel.
And this is true, without going full length with Las Casas in his fiery fanaticism
when he says:—"Oviedo should regret what he has written of the Indians;
he has borne false witness against them; and has calumniated them in
every way.... He should have inscribed on his title-page, 'This book was
written by a conqueror, robber, and murderer of the Indians, whole populations
of whom he consigned to the mines, where they perished'.... His work
is as full of lies as of pages." To which sentiment I by no means subscribe.
Probably no kind of work, however thoroughly and conscientiously done, is
more open to criticism, is more certain to be criticised on every side, than contemporaneous
history from facts for the first time gathered, and from many
and conflicting witnesses. Ternaux-Compans says well:—"Oviedo n'est pas
exempt des préjugés de son temps contre les Indiens, mais après tout, ce qu'il
dit se rapproche plus de la vérité que les peintures fantastiques de l'évêque
de Chiapa, qui veut retrouver l'âge d'or même chez les nations les plus féroces."
Both of these authors, Las Casas and Oviedo, wrote in the heat of the engagement
of the abnormal and ill-understood scenes passing under their immediate
notice. What they wrote was certainly true to them; it is our business
to analyze and sift, and make their records true to us. In the showy
criticisms of these and a kindred class of authors we see generally something
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_312' href='#Page_312'>312</a></span>
brought in about style and arrangement. The latter is always bad, and the
index worse than none; but critics should find something better to do than
find fault with the words and their arrangement of these old fighting chroniclers.
Of course their style is bad, abominable; but who cares for style in
them? One wants only the facts. Their books are not made to be read, but
to be used. Rios seems to entertain a proper appreciation of the matter when
he writes:—"Mas ya fuera porque procurase dar á su lectura aquella diversidad,
tantas veces por él apetecida, ya porque la misma fatiga é irregularidad
con que recibia los datos, le impidiese someterlos á un plan maduro é inalterable;
es lo cierto que la crítica de nuestros dias, al par que aprecia y agradece
tan interesantes inquisiciones, echa de menos cierta cohesion y armonia en la
exposicion de las costumbres de los indios, no hallando mayor enlace en la
narracion de los descubrimientos y conquistas, que ni se refieren siempre en
órden cronológico, ni guardan entre sí la conveniente relacion para que pueda
comprenderse sin dificultad su influencia recíproca."

<div class="sidenote">PETER MARTYR'S WORKS.</div>

<p>
While the Protector of the Indians and the First Chronicler of the New
World were thus gathering and recording historical data in the several parts
of America, one of the most learned men of Europe, Pietro Martire d'Anghiera,
or latinized Anglerius, commonly called Peter Martyr, was collecting
similar facts in Spain, and recording them, copiously diluted with the philosophy
of the day, in the form of ten-year epochs, constituting in the end a
series of decades. The duchy of Milan was the early home of this chronicler,
and 1457 the year of his birth. His family was of noble descent, and
originally of Anghiera. Going to Rome in 1477 to finish his education, he
became so conspicuous for learning and eloquence that ten years later the
Spanish ambassador invited him to try his fortune at the court of the Spanish
sovereigns. By them he was graciously received, especially by Isabella, who
wished to occupy him in the instruction of the young nobles of Castile. The
ardent Italian must have a taste of war, however, before settling into permanent
sagedom; so he fought before Baza, and laid not down the sword till the
city of the Alhambra fell. Then he became a priest, and turned toward pursuits
more in keeping with his natural bent and erudition. He opened various
schools of learning, which youth of quality made it the fashion to attend.
Having risen into high consideration at court, in 1501 he was sent by the
crown on missions to Venice and Cairo, in which he acquitted himself creditably,
and wrote on his return the <i>De Legatione Babylonicâ</i>, an account of Lower
Egypt in three books. On Ferdinand's death he was appointed by Jimenez
ambassador to the Sultan Selim, but refused the honor on account of his
age; and afterward he did not find Charles less inclined to acknowledge
his merits. During the three years following his return from Egypt he
was appointed prior of the cathedral of Granada, and by the pope apostolic
prothonotary, and in 1518 he took his seat in the Council of the Indies.
His life was one of rare industry, in which he gathered and disseminated
much knowledge, and which gained him the respect of princes; his death
occurred in 1526, in the 69th year of his age, and he was buried in his cathedral
at Granada. Peter Martyr is the author of at least two great works,
viewed historically. They are written in Latin, of anything but Ciceronian
ring, for patristic is to the patrician Latin as the 'Frenche of Stratford atte
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_313' href='#Page_313'>313</a></span>
Bowe' is to the French of Paris. Of these his two notable works the chief
is <i>De Orbe Novo</i>, an account of the New World and its wonders, in eight decades,
or books. The first, and the first three, of these decades were published
at different times during the author's life, but the eight decades complete did
not appear before 1530, when they were printed at Alcalá under the title <i>De
Orbe Novo Petri Martyris ab Angleria Mediolanensis Protonotarii Cæsaris senatoris
decades</i>. Three of the decades translated into English by R. Eden were
printed in 1555, and reprinted in 1577, with another decade added by R.
Willes. The best complete edition of the eight decades, in their original Latin,
next appeared in Paris, published by R. Hakluyt, 1587. Indeed, beside the
edition of 1530, this is the only complete original edition of the <i>De Orbe Novo</i>.
In 1612 appeared the work entire in English, the result of the 'Industrie
and painefull Trauaile of M. Lok Gent.' This has been included in a supplement
to <i>Hakluyt's Voyages</i>, London, 1812. Beside these important editions,
partial translations, extracts, and compilations have appeared at various
times and in various languages. In 1534, at Venice, in Italian, were published,
in three several parts, summaries of the history of the Indies taken
from Peter Martyr, Oviedo, and others. The other of the two works alluded
to is a collection of Peter Martyr's letters, in Latin, which brim with notices
of contemporary events, and run from 1488 to his death. Two editions of
these collected letters were published, the first at Alcalá in 1530, the second
at Amsterdam, by the Elzevirs, in 1670. The title runs thus—<i>Opus Epistolarum
Petri Martyris Anglerii Mediolanensis</i>, etc.; a translation of the letters
has never been published. So confused, misdated, and interposed are the
epistles that Hallam expressed his disbelief in any connection whatever between
actual and ostensible dates and service. But the <i>De Orbe Novo</i> may
be regarded equal in authority to the relations of the eye-witnesses Las Casas
and Oviedo. Peter Martyr was the first of the chroniclers to write and to
publish on the New World, his decades beginning to appear about the time
Oviedo first went to the Indies. Immediately Columbus set foot on shore, on
his return from the first voyage, the eloquent and philosophic scholar began
to question him and those who came with him, and to write, and he never
ceased writing until death stopped him. There was so much for a man of his
mind to think and talk about. For a time after this marvellous discovery the
learned and intelligently curious lived in a ferment concerning it. It was to
some extent the revolutionizing of science and philosophy. The lines of tradition
were snapped; the cosmos had lost its continuity. Peter Martyr, a
grave man of broad and deep capabilities; well situated for procuring information,
meeting daily, many of them at his own table, those who had returned
from the Indies—discoverers, conquerors, explorers, sailors, priests,
and cavaliers—having access to the official letters, diaries, charts, and relations
of these men, his account, I say, should be as reliable and as valuable
as that of one who had actually mingled in the scenes described. In some
respects it should be more so, able as he was to see with a hundred eyes
instead of two, and to determine disputes more coolly and equitably. It
is true his, records are marred by the haste with which they were written,
and by the admitted lack of correction or revision by the author; order and
method are nowhere present; mistakes and contradictions are frequent. But
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_314' href='#Page_314'>314</a></span>
we have the raw material, which is far better than any elaboration. Las
Casas was the first of the chroniclers to visit the Indies, and the last of the
three thus far named to begin to write and publish history, which was in
1552. Oviedo began to write at about the date the history of Las Casas terminates.
It was four years after the death of Peter Martyr that Oviedo was
appointed official chronicler of the New World. The general relations of the
three historians were antagonistic; from which their writings may all the
better be brought to harmonize with truth. Of the hundreds who have made
their criticisms on the writings of Peter Martyr I will mention but two.
Says Las Casas, <i>Hist. Ind.</i>, i. 32: "De los cuales cerca destas primeras cosas
á ninguno se debe dar más fe que á Pedro Martir;" and Muñoz remarks, <i>Hist.
Nuevo Mundo</i>, xiii.: "Merece indulgencia por el candor con que lo confiesa
todo, por su ningun afan en publicar sus borrones, y principalmente porque tal
qual es la obra de las décadas contiene muchísimas especies que no se hallan
en otra parte alguna, y estas escritas con la conveniente libertad por un autor
coetáneo, grave, culto, bien instruido de los hechos, y de probidad conocida."
</p>

<div class="sidenote">GOMARA AND HERRERA.</div>

<p>
Of much less importance than the preceding are the writings of Francisco
Lopez Gomara, particularly his history of the Indies, which is an imitation
rather than a genuine original, and of which too much has been made, notwithstanding
Muñoz pronounces it the first history worthy the name. Although
Icazbalceta, a high authority on the subject, gives the name Gómara,
or Gómora, with the accent on the first syllable as the Peninsular pronunciation,
with the remark that it is commonly called Gomára in Mexico, I have
not thought best to depart from an almost universal usage. Bustamante
goes out of his way to signify an accent where it would naturally fall, writing
Gomára. Born in Seville in 1510, of an illustrious family—it seems exceptional
to find any man of note in Spain whose family was not illustrious—and
educated at the university of Alcalá, he became a doctor of both civil and canonical
law, and filled for a time the chair of rhetoric. From the military life
designed for him by his parents he was driven by literary tastes into the priesthood;
and in 1540, upon the return of Cortés from his last visit to Mexico, he
became chaplain and secretary to the marquis. From this some have inferred
and erroneously stated that he spent four years in America prior to publishing
his history. At Saragossa in 1552-3 appeared his <i>La Historia General de
las Indias</i>, in two folio parts, the first general, and dealing chiefly with Peru,
the other devoted to Mexico. The book was popular; and in 1553 from
Medina del Campo issued another folio edition; and another from Saragossa
the year following, with this difference as to the last, however, that its second
part was treated as a separate work and entitled <i>Cronica de la nueua España con
la conquista de Mexico, y otras cosas notables: hechas por el Valoroso Hernando
Cortes</i>, while the first part appropriated the original title of <i>Historia General</i>,
etc. Then appeared an edition at Antwerp, 1554, and one in which the date,
1552, is evidently spurious. The author seems to have handled government
affairs too roughly; for in 1553 we find the book suppressed by royal decree,
which, however, was not fully enforced, and was revoked in 1729. Barcia
printed a mutilation of the two works in his <i>Hist. Prim.</i>, ii., in 1749, and the
two were again published, in a correct form, in <i>Biblioteca de Autores Españoles</i>,
xxii., Madrid, 1852. A somewhat singular case occurred in Mexico in 1826,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_315' href='#Page_315'>315</a></span>
when was issued, in 2 volumes 8vo, <i>Historia de las Conquistas de Hernando
Cortés, escrita en Español por Francisco Lopez de Gomára, traducida al Mexicano
y aprobada por verdadera por D. Juan Bautista de San Anton Muñon
Chimalpain Quauhtlehuanitzin, Indio Mexicano. Publílcala para instruccion
de la juventud nacional, con varias notas y adiciones, Carlos María de Bustamante</i>,
which being interpreted, at best is confused. It says that the work,
written in Spanish by Gomara, was translated into the Mexican language,
and there leaves it. On turning over the leaves we find the book printed in
Spanish, and not in Nahuatl, as we were led to suppose. Nor does a lengthy
preface by Bustamante make the matter clear in every respect. Turning
to other sources, and by comparing all information, we finally learn that
Bustamante and others once believed in the existence, somewhere, of a
history of Mexico, by the learned and noble native Chimalpain. Probably it
lay hidden in some one of the libraries or government offices about Mexico.
Boturini spoke of various historical manuscripts written by Domingo de San
Anton Muñon Chimalpain, some in Castilian, and some in Nahuatl. Note,
in passing, the difference in the name, here Domingo, and in the title Juan
Bautista. Clavigero, Leon Pinelo, Beristain, and Antonio de Leon y Gama also
vaguely mentioned some work or works by Chimalpain. Bustamante claimed,
at first, to have found the Mexican history of Chimalpain in manuscript,
and obtained contributions of money from various sources to enable him to
print a translation of it, with notes. But before the translation was fairly
issued in Spanish, the editor was obliged to confess himself mistaken as to
its being an original work; it was only Gomara rendered into Mexican by the
learned Indian, and now translated back again into Spanish by Bustamante, the
text much marred by the double transformation, but enriched by notes from
both editors. There are men so uncharitable as to say that Don Carlos María
Bustamante never found Chimalpain's translation, because Chimalpain never
made one. I do not know. Any one of three or four ways was possible. Bustamante
may have found the alleged translation of Chimalpain, and while translating
into Spanish what he believed an original work, may have discovered it
to be Gomara; it may have been then in type or printed, or too far advanced
to stop; or it may be Bustamante, having received the money, felt bound to go
on with the work, and concluded to trust to his own and Chimalpain's notes to
satisfy those concerned and the public; or Bustamante may have perpetrated
a deliberate fraud. This last, although he is openly accused of it by his
countrymen high in authority, I can scarcely believe to be the true solution
of the mystery, and rather lean to the first possibility; but I must say that
Bustamante committed a serious mistake in not admitting this frankly, if
true. Gomara's history was translated into Italian, and published at Rome,
one edition, 4to, in 1555, and one in 1556; and at Venice, one in 8vo, 1565,
one in 4to, 1566, and in 8vo again, in 1576. In French, at Paris, six editions
in 8vo, 1569, 1578, 1580, 1584, 1587, and 1597, the last five reprints of the first,
except slight augmentations in the last three. London furnished an English
translation by Henry Bynneman, in 4to, in 1578. The prologue warns all
persons against translating the book into Latin, as he was engaged thereat
himself; but his Latin version never appeared. Gomara wrote well. His
style is better than that of any predecessor; but while his opportunities were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_316' href='#Page_316'>316</a></span>
great, for he had culture, leisure, and access to the knowledge and material
of Cortés, it is painfully apparent that his desire was greater to please the
master than to present a plain unvarnished tale.
</p>

<p>
And now, after a century of writing and discussions, comes Antonio de
Herrera y Tordesillas as royal historiographer to gather, arrange, and embody
in one general history all knowledge available at that time. It was a
work needing attention; for if it were further postponed much information
then obtainable would be lost. He was born in Cuéllar in 1549, and although
the father bore the name of Tordesillas and the mother of Herrera, for the
sake of euphony, distinction, or other unknown vagary, the son took the
name of his mother, a thing not unusual then or now in Spain. At an
early age we find him in Italy holding the position of secretary to Vespasiano
Gonzaga, viceroy of Naples, upon whose death Herrera was so well recommended
to Philip II. that, in 1596, he was made chief historiographer for the
Indies. Honored also with the title of historiographer of Castile and Leon,
he fulfilled the duties of both offices through portions of the reigns of the three
Philips, II., III., and IV. He was likewise nominated for the first vacant
place among the secretaries of state, but died before that vacancy occurred,
in the 76th year of his age. As an historian Herrera has made a respectable
place for himself, but his reputation rests principally, though not wholly, for
he wrote much, on his <i>Historia General de los Hechos de los Castellanos en las
Islas i Tierra Firme del Mar oceano ecrita por Antonio de Herrera coronista mayor
de sv M:<sup>d</sup> d las Indias y sv coronista de Castilla</i>, 4 vols. folio, Madrid, 1601-15.
On the elaborately engraved title-page of the first volume is added, <i>En quatro
Decadas desde el Año de 1492 hasta el de 1531</i>, which refers only to the first two
volumes, as the whole four volumes consist of 8 decades, comprising general
events to 1554. The first two volumes were printed in 1601, and reprinted at
Valladolid in 1606; the second two volumes appeared in 1615. The work was
freely translated; the first decade appearing in French, at Paris, in 1659,
and with the second decade the year following, the remaining decades in
1671. A most vile translation into English was made by John Stevens and
published in London, in 6 volumes, the first two in 1725 and the last four in
1726, new editions of which appeared in 1740 and 1743. There were two
reprints in Spanish; one in Antwerp, in 1728, by Verdussen, without maps and
otherwise faulty; and one in Madrid, 1728-30, with notes, corrections, and
index by Barcia, and therefore better than the first edition, in fact the best
extant. At the end of the second volume of the first edition, and as a prefix
to the first volume of the Barcia edition, should appear the <i>Description de las
Indias Occidentales</i>, with maps, translations of which were made in Latin,
Dutch, and French. An attempt was made to carry on Herrera's history, and
it was continued for three decades, from 1555 to 1584, by Pedro Fernandez del
Pulgar, the chronicler who succeeded Solis, but it was not deemed of sufficient
importance to print. The original manuscript is in the Royal Library
at Madrid. Herrera was quite a voluminous writer, being author of a general
history during the reign of Philip II.; of a history of Scotland and England
during the life of Mary Stuart; of Portugal, and the conquest of the Azores;
of France from 1585 to 1594, and of moral and political tracts, and historical,
political, and ecclesiastical translations. But though all his works were highly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_317' href='#Page_317'>317</a></span>
prized for their erudition, none attained the celebrity of his History of the
Indies. Even to-day he may be called chief among historians of Spanish-American
affairs; not for his style, bald, and accurately prolix; nor for his
method, slavishly chronological, and miserably failing in the attempt to do
several things at once; but because of his massed material. His position as
state historiographer gave him, of course, access to everything, and he made
use of his opportunity to an extent then exceptional. At a later period in
the art of history-writing his work must have been regarded as crude even
for early times. But from one who lived when piety and patriotism were
ranked as the highest virtues, higher than truth, integrity, or humanity, the
more searching philosophy cannot be expected. Beside the faults of style and
arrangement there are evidences everywhere of inexperience and incompetent
assistance. Now that we have before us many of the sources of Herrera's
material we can see that his notes were badly extracted, and compiled in a
bungling manner; so much so that in addition to the ordinary errors, from
which to some extent the most carefully executed work cannot be expected to
be wholly free, there are many and serious discrepancies and contradictions
for which there is no excuse, the cause being simply carelessness. Yet, for all
that, Herrera's is not only the most complete, but one of the most reliable of
the New World chronicles, and for this the writer merits the gratitude not
alone of his countrymen but of the world.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">COMMENTARY ON THE EARLY CHRONICLERS.</div>

<p class="p2">
Before closing this note, I will give clearly my opinion regarding the credibility
of the early chroniclers, including in that category for the present purpose
all the early writers, conquerors as well as historians, such as Columbus
and Cortés, Bernal Diaz, Solis, Torquemada, Boturini, and the Anonymous
Conqueror; for I have been assailed by those who, to gain cheap notoriety in
refuting them, have attributed to me doctrines which I have nowhere expressed
or held. They who cannot build for themselves seem to think it
gravely incumbent on them to demolish any structure another may rear, and
with one scurrile sweep they would wipe out the work of twenty years. They
are correct enough to this extent, that, if ever a building is found so frail as
to fall under their attacks, it does not deserve to stand. Hence we find it
the fashion in certain quarters, under cover of criticism, to repudiate the early
writings, in so far at least as they interfere with cherished theory or dogmatic
opinion. Spain had lately emerged from the Moorish wars with great glory,
they say, and Spaniards in the New World, so long as it remained with them
to tell the story, would not be in the least behind their brethren at home in
this new field of fiery exploits. Hence, for their accounts, naked barbarians
were gorgeously apparelled, and surrounded by stately pageantry; art, science,
and literature wholly mythical were given them, and cities equal, at
least, to the average of civilization were built. Instance the Tenochtitlan,
the Tezcuco, the Tlacopan of Cortés and his contemporaries, which must have
been pure fictions. Else where are the vestiges of the walls and gardens
and palaces? There are no ruins of splendid cities, they continue with the
effrontery of ignorance, no remains of aqueducts, stone carvings, and tumuli.
There are some fine ruins in Central America and Yucatan, they admit, displaying
no mean advancement in architectural art; but they must have been
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_318' href='#Page_318'>318</a></span>
the work of Egyptians, or Phœnicians, or some other foreigners, because
they resemble the ruins standing among those nations, and because no aboriginal
people capable of such performance exist in America to-day. There
was no human sacrifice in Mexico, because bigoted ecclesiastics in those days
were apt to invest with religious significance every hieroglyph, statue, and
consecrated stone. One, more virulent than the rest, himself of Indian origin
and apparently jealous lest other aboriginals should outshine his Cherokee
ancestry, and knowing little either of the Mexicans or their conquerors, denies
the existence of a Nahua or Maya civilization and denounces every one who
differs in opinion with him, on the ground that all American societies of which
he knew aught were formed on one skeleton, a most earthy, red, and ignoble
one, and that the conquerors, not understanding this social structure, could
not correctly describe it, and therefore their statements are not to be relied on.
</p>

<p>
I can only say that I have studied these chronicles some score of years,
that I have studied the monumental and literary remains of the nations conquered,
that, apart from the modern writings of both those who believe and
those who disbelieve, I have instituted comparisons and weighed evidence
with no more desire to reach one conclusion than another, except always to
arrive at the right one; and that in my own mind I am well enough satisfied
as to about the measure of truth that should be accorded the respective writers
of early New World annals. Others, my assistants and friends, equally
earnest and unbiassed, equally desirous of reaching only the truth, and for
whose convictions I entertain the highest respect, have devoted many years
to the same research and with similar results. It is not my purpose, nor has
it ever been, to appear as the champion of the sixteenth-century chroniclers.
It is not my province to champion anything. It is a matter of profound indifference
to me what these or those are proven to be, whether angels of light
or devils of darkness; it is a matter of lively apprehension with me that I
should estimate men and nations at their value, and deduce only truth from
statements fair or false. While I entertain a distinct conception of the status
of the Aztecs and Quichés relatively to other nations of the globe, I have no
theory concerning the origin of the Americans, or the origin of their civilization—except
that it seems to me indigenous rather than exotic; nor should
I deem it wise in me to husband a doctrine on this or any other palpably
unprovable proposition.
</p>

<p>
I am not prepared by any means to accept as truth all that has been said
by priest and soldier. No one is readier than I to admit their frequent
attempted deceptions. Navigators the world over have been notoriously untrue
in regard to their discoveries, giving strange lands strange sights, stocking
barren shores with boundless wealth in pearls, and gems, and precious
metals, peopling the ocean with monsters, and placing islands, straits, continents,
and seas wherever the gaping savans at home would have them. Many
of these stories are false on their very face, being contrary to nature and to
reason. Some of them are unintentional falsehoods, the off-float from imaginations
warped by education, and now morbidly excited under new conditions.
By bodily suffering and perils the mind was now and then reduced
to the border of insanity; at which times the miracles, the visions, and
the supernatural interpositions they record were real to them. But the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_319' href='#Page_319'>319</a></span>
best of the early writers wilfully lied in some things, and held it serving
God to do so.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">WEIGHT OF EVIDENCE.</div>

<p>
Although the temptation and tendency was to exaggerate, to make the New
World conquest equal or superior to any Old World achievement; although
assertions were at the first not open to contradiction, and the sailors and
soldiers of those times, returned from foreign parts, were no more celebrated
for telling the truth than those of our own day, yet in the main and as a whole
the writings of the Spaniards earliest in America are unquestionably true.
Most of the several phases of error and misstatement are easily enough
detected, the events described being either impossible or opposed to preponderant
and superior evidence. For example, when Las Casas, who was conscientious
and in the main correct, asserts that Manicaotex opposed Columbus
at the head of 100,000 warriors in Española, we may safely put it down as exaggeration
simply from our general knowledge, gained from other sources, of
the aboriginal population of these islands and the adjoining continent. Here
was a multitude of witnesses, European and American, whose verbal or written
statements were usually subordinate to substantial facts, unknown to each
other, and giving their evidence at widely different times and places. Often
the conquerors fell out and fought each other to the death, writing to Spain
lengthy epistles of vindication and vilification, many of which have been preserved;
so that where one extolled himself and his achievements, there were
a dozen to pull him down. Thus from a mass of contradictory statements, on
either side of which the less penetrating are apt to linger, to the patient and
laborious investigator unfold the clearest truths. He who habitually practises
deceit is sure somewhere to expose himself; and the taking of evidence
does not proceed far before the examiner can tell the witness more than
he himself knows or remembers of the scenes through which he has passed.
The native witnesses, living at the time of the Conquest and subsequently,
were likewise naturally inclined unduly to magnify the glories of their ancestors
and of their nation; yet to verify their statements they point to the
monuments and material remains then and now existing, to manuscripts, huge
piles of which it was the infamous boast of the fanatical conquerors to have
burned, but of which enough have been preserved to authenticate all the
more important parts of their stories; they also refer to tradition, which is
worth as much, and no more, than that of other nations.
</p>

<p>
Blank assertions similar to those advanced against the New World chroniclers
might with equal reason and effect be brought forward to overthrow
the early records of any nation. Christ and Confucius may be denied,
Homer and Shakespeare, but that does not prove they never lived. That
Columbus made his seamen swear that no doubt Cuba was Zipangu, does
not prove that there was in those days no Japan. Because Drake's chaplain
chose to tell the most monstrous and wilful falsehoods respecting the climate,
metals, and inhabitants of California; because Cook, Meares, and Vancouver
sailed by the mouth of the Columbia, superciliously scourging those who
had spoken of it, this does not prove the non-existence of Marin County,
or of the River of the West. In such ways as these neither the truth
of the one statement nor the falsity of the other is established. But, as I
have observed, before us is abundant evidence, palpable and incontestable,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_320' href='#Page_320'>320</a></span>
that the early writings on America are for the most part true; and if, in the
following pages, it does not clearly appear which are true and which false,
then has the author signally failed in his effort. I do not in the least
fear the overthrow of the general veracity of these writers until there come
against them enemies more powerful with more powerful weapons than any
that have yet appeared. How senselessly speculative their reasonings! Because
the natives of the present day cannot tell who or whence were the
authors of the carvings, or the builders of the structures upon whose ruins
they have gazed since childhood, these works must forsooth have been done
by foreign visitors. Europeans now and then may have found their way to
America, but I find no evidence of such visits before the time of Columbus
except by the Northmen; no one knows of such, nor can know until more
light appears. The material relics, I fancy, will always prove a stumbling-block
to those who would reject American aboriginal civilization.
</p>

<p>
That different conquerors, teachers, and travellers of various creeds and
nationalities, in various pursuits, in different lands and at various times, together
with native testimony, hieroglyphic writings, and traditions, to say
nothing of carvings in stone and other monumental remains, should all combine,
with satanic inspiration, to perpetrate upon the world one grand and
overwhelming fraud is so preposterously ridiculous that the marvel is how
there could be found, outside the walls of a lunatic asylum, a single individual
with cool impudence enough to ask men to believe it. And yet there
are several such, and they find believers. So charmed by the sound of their
own voice are these captious cavillers, that they apparently do not deem it possible
for such things to exist in this enlightened age as pedantic ignorance
and literary fanaticism, of which they are bright examples. They do not seem
to know that the petty and puerile theories which they would pass upon the
simple as startling conceptions, original with themselves, are as old as the
knowledge of the continent. They do not consider that before taking the
first step toward proving origin, migration, or kinship by analogy, they must
first dispose of the universal relationship of man, the oneness of human nature,
human needs, and human aspirations, and then show how men first came
upon this earth, and which was land and which water then and since. But
those who thus array themselves against American aboriginal civilization and
the early Spanish writers on the New World do not pretend to offer counter
evidence, or to refute with reason; they rely chiefly on flat contradiction. I
have yet to find among them all any approach to reasonable propositions or
logical argument. They have nothing on which to base argument, neither
fact nor plausible supposition. Their hypotheses are as chimerical as their
deductions are false. They would have the world exercise a far more irrational
credulity in accepting their hollow negations, than in believing every
word of the most mendacious chronicler. And when they come to deny the
presence of a native civilization upon the Mexican table-land, they betray
lamentable ignorance both of the facts of history and of the nature of civilization.

</p>

<p>
When Alonso de Ojeda left San Sebastian for
Española, he stipulated with Francisco Pizarro, who
for the time was commissioned governor, that should
neither he himself return, nor the bachiller Enciso
arrive within fifty days, the colonists might abandon
the post and seek safety or adventure in other parts.
</p>

<p>
And now the fifty days had passed; wearily and
hungrily they had come and gone, with misery an
ever present guest; and no one having come, they dismantled
the fortress, placed on board the two small
brigantines left them the gold they had secured—trust
Francisco Pizarro for scenting gold, and getting
it—and made ready to embark for Santo Domingo.
But though only seventy remained, the vessels could
not carry them all; and it was agreed that they should
wait awhile, until death reduced their number to the
capacity of the boats.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_322' href='#Page_322'>322</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Nor had they long to wait; nor would their grim
attendant let them put to sea without him. He had
been so long domiciled with them, and had become
so useful in settling disputes, adjusting accounts, and
the like, that he was one of them, and one, indeed,
with all the companies which attempted colonization
on these pestilential shores. As they coasted eastward
in search of food before steering across for
Española, a squall struck the vessels, overturning one
of them and sending all on board to swift destruction.
Entering with the other the harbor of Cartagena,
Pizarro found there the tardy Enciso hunting his
colony.
</p>

<p>
Now the bachiller, beside possessing great learning,
was a man of experience, all the way from Spain;
a man of keen intelligence and practical sagacity, his
wits sharpened by the narrow-minded legal bigotry
of a sixteenth-century Spanish lawyer. He must
be of exceedingly ready wit who could deceive the
bachiller. It was scarcely to be expected a man of
his kidney should credit the stories of Ojeda's visit
to Santo Domingo, of the deputy governorship, and
of the late disaster; though honest Pizarro on this
occasion told only the truth, and his companions
vouched for it with all the feeble force of their high-keyed
husky voices. If Ojeda had gone to Santo
Domingo more than fifty or seventy days before,
would not the bachiller have seen him there? Indeed,
to a less erudite judge than Enciso, a band of
robbers on the high seas, with an abundance of gold
and no bread, would call up suspicions rather of foul
play than honest adventure. And back they must
go. The functions of high judge should begin here
and now. Was not this Nueva Andalucía? With
the horrors of San Sebastian still fresh in their
minds, the thought of returning there was repugnant
in the extreme, and the poor wretches begged the
lawyer to let them go to Española, or join Nicuesa.
No. Enciso had staked his whole earthly possessions
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_323' href='#Page_323'>323</a></span>
on the delightful prospect of domination, and
these should not escape him. They were just the
clay for his fashioning; men for whom the law was
made. Whipping out his commission, which at once
deposed Pizarro, the bachiller drove them back into
their boat, and all embarked for San Sebastian. But
scarcely had they turned the Punta de Caribana,<a id='FA_VII-1' href='#FN_VII-1' class='fnanchor'>[VII-1]</a>
when the bachiller's well-stored ship struck upon
rocks and broke in pieces, those on board barely
escaping with their lives. Thus the worthy bachiller
was beggared; the savings from life-long pettifoggings
were swept away within the hour. Still his
original stock in trade, egotism and arrogance, was
left unimpaired.

<div class="sidenote">ADMINISTRATION OF ENCISO.</div>

<p>
Making their way along the shore to San Sebastian,
the Spaniards found their fort demolished and
their houses, some thirty in number, burned. In a
feeble way they began to forage again, but even Enciso
saw that it was useless. The absence of food,
the poisoned arrows, and the poisoned air were too
much for the bravest long to contend with. "Let us
leave this accursed spot," they all cried. "Whither
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_324' href='#Page_324'>324</a></span>
would you go?" demanded the lawyer. One of them
said:—"Once when I coasted this gulf with Rodrigo
de Bastidas, along the western shore we found the
country fertile and rich in gold. Provisions were
abundant; and the natives, though warlike, used no
poisoned arrows. Through this land of which I
speak flows a river called by the natives Darien."
</p>

<div class="sidenote">VASCO NUÑEZ DE BALBOA.</div>

<p>
All eyes were turned upon the speaker. It was
the <i>hombre del casco</i>, Vasco Nuñez de Balboa, a fine
specimen of the Spanish cavalier, at that time about
thirty-five years of age. He was taller than Ojeda,
though perhaps not stronger; there was not about
him the assurance of breeding and position that Nicuesa
bore; nor were there present in his features
those marks of greed and brutality plainly discernible
in the face of Francisco Pizarro, who stood not far
from him. Strong and comely in every part, apparently,
of body and mind, one to be observed with
intuitive respect in a society of this kind, one to be
approached with ease, but with due care; frank and
manly, with a firm and winning eye and manner,
yet there was about him noticeable something between
shyness and reticence. Indeed, the standing
of this person, since his sudden and altogether informal
appearing as one of the present company had
been somewhat dubious, and he seemed to regard it
good taste to hold himself rather in the background.
For all this there was that innate superiority about
him over every one present, not excepting the erudite
judge or the subsequently cunning conqueror of Peru,
that could not always remain concealed, particularly
amid constantly recurring vital issues.
</p>

<p>
Of the invariable poor but noble family, a native
of Jerez de los Caballeros, Vasco Nuñez was reared
in the service of Pedro Puertocarrero, the deaf
lord of Moguer. Drawn with the crowd to the
New World, upon the abrupt termination of the
voyage of Bastidas, he obtained a repartimiento of
Indians, and applied himself to agriculture at Salvatierra,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_325' href='#Page_325'>325</a></span>
a town of Española. Becoming embarrassed
by debts, and disgusted with the plodding life of a
farmer, he determined to try fortune in the new
colony of Alonso de Ojeda. But how to escape his
creditors was the question. Debtors were prohibited
by edict from leaving the island. The town of Santo
Domingo at this time swarmed with insolvent adventurers
anxious to engage in new adventure, and the
strictest watch was kept on them by the authorities.
An armed escort accompanied every departure until
well out at sea, to bring back discovered stowaways.
For all this Vasco Nuñez determined to sail with
Enciso. Now mark the budding of genius! Taking
a large cask, such as was used in shipping stores, he
ensconced himself therein, and caused it to be headed
up, placed upon a wagon, and driven from his farm
to the landing, where it was placed with the other
stores, and finally carried on board the ship. The
vessel put to sea; the tender returned to port; to
the creditors was left the farm of Vasco Nuñez, while
the late owner was forever safe beyond their reach.<a id='FA_VII-2' href='#FN_VII-2' class='fnanchor'>[VII-2]</a>
</p>

<p>
When, like Aphrodite from her circling shell, the
serio-comic face of the bankrupt farmer appeared
emerging from the provision cask, the bachiller was
disposed to treat the matter magisterially, and threatened
to land the refugee from justice on the first
deserted island. But as the learned judge could not
be held accountable as a party to the fraud, and as
he thereby gained a valuable recruit, his judicial
sensitiveness was finally mollified, and he assigned
to the stowaway the ordinary duties of a soldier.
Nevertheless the mildly murderous threat of the
lawyer was not lost upon the farmer.
</p>

<p>
Into the hearts of the desponding colonists at San
Sebastian the words of Vasco Nuñez infused new
life. No time was lost in making ready; and crossing
the gulf, they found the country and river as he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_326' href='#Page_326'>326</a></span>
had said. Near this river of Darien,<a id='FA_VII-3' href='#FN_VII-3' class='fnanchor'>[VII-3]</a> for so the
Atrato and country thereabout was then called, stood
the village of the cacique, Cemaco, a brave and
upright ruler.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">BATTLE OF ANTIGUA.</div>

<p>
Enciso, who is no less valiant than wise and conscientious,
determines to make this place judicially
his own. Cemaco, who believes himself the legal
owner, objects. Whereupon is invoked that admirable
provision, the ultimate appeal; and the man
of the long robe and the man of no robe at all,
each after his fashion, prepare for war. Sending
his women and children up the river, Cemaco posts
himself with five hundred warriors before the village.
Enciso, in whose person are united the combined
essences of Christendom, civil, ecclesiastical,
and military, concentrates all his forces, human and
divine, to hurl upon the presumptuous savage. First,
as is his wont in legal battles, to every soldier he
administers the oath that he will not flinch before
the enemy; then he invokes the powers above to aid
him in the approaching contest, vowing that if victory
shall be his and the town shall fall into his hands he
will name it in honor of the virgin and build and dedicate
a church within the town in honor of her sacred
image, Antigua of Seville. Moreover, he promises
that he will make a pilgrimage to her holy shrine if
she will give him the victory over Cemaco; and with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_327' href='#Page_327'>327</a></span>
these preparations the battle begins. The half-starved
Spaniards fight like fiends. Cemaco for a time maintains
his position with firmness; but the awe-inspiring
appearance of the strangers, their ship, their shining
armor, their beards, the whiteness of their skin, the
wonderful sharpness of their weapons, and the solemn
thunder and smoke of their fire-arms soon scatter to
the forest his terror-smitten people. To the unbounded
joy of the conquerors the town is found rich
in gold and cotton, and the adjacent fields afford
abundance of provisions.
</p>

<p>
This is something like reward for toilsome missionary
labors. Along the river banks, secreted in
caves, are found golden ornaments to the value of
ten thousand castellanos.<a id='FA_VII-4' href='#FN_VII-4' class='fnanchor'>[VII-4]</a> The virgin's share and
the king's share are set aside, and the remainder of
the spoils divided among the band. Thus Cemaco's
village becomes the seat of government in Tierra
Firme; and to it, as the lawyer promised the virgin,
is given the name of Santa María de la Antigua del
Darien.<a id='FA_VII-5' href='#FN_VII-5' class='fnanchor'>[VII-5]</a>
</p>

<p>
In good truth fortune had at length smiled upon
the colonists. Captives taken in the skirmishes which
followed the pitched battle were made to gather gold
and work in the fields. The bachiller began a rigorous
rule with a full sense of the responsibilities resting
upon him as representative of the crown of Spain and
of his own importance before his soldiers, and as a
hero in the great work of pacification. This view
of his own merits appeared to him by no means diminished
after his recent success. Though small in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_328' href='#Page_328'>328</a></span>
number, this colony should be mighty in law. Poor
Ojeda! How happy he might have been in the
position now occupied by this mummified bundle of
quiddities.
</p>

<p>
Settling themselves in Cemaco's houses, the Spaniards
began to look about. First in order after his
lawless raid, in the eyes of Enciso, was law. The
bachiller, as we have ere this surmised, was one of
those super-wise and self-opinioned men who to
achieve a fall have only to attain a height. Very
little law was here needed, very little government;
but Enciso was a lawyer and a ruler, and little of it
would not suffice him. His first edict was the prohibition
of private traffic with the natives. This
measure, though strictly legal, could scarcely be called
politic. The hundred or so ragged piratical wretches
cast on this rich and feebly defended shore wanted
few decrees; and the fewer laws their ruler made for
them the fewer would be broken. But, necessary or
not, the alcalde mayor must issue orders, else he is
no alcalde mayor. Hence other regulations followed,
equally unpopular, until the colonists began to consider
how best they might make a plug which should
stop this great running to waste of law. Though
convinced that Enciso was planning to get the gold
as well as the government all into his own hands,
and employ the colonists as tools wherewith to mine,
and hold the savages in check, so inbred is Spanish
loyalty, that even the reckless members of this crude
commonwealth hesitated before committing any overt
act which might forever outlaw them from their
country. Better employ his own weapon against the
bachiller, for law is safer than hemp for hanging even
lawyers.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">VASCO NUÑEZ ASSUMES COMMAND.</div>

<p>
There was about Vasco Nuñez a plain directness
of thought and purpose the very opposite of those
engendered of the law's entanglements. Ever since
his fortunate suggestion to cross from San Sebastian
to Darien he had been regarded as the savior of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_329' href='#Page_329'>329</a></span>
colony; and now he thought he saw open a way of
deliverance from their present trouble, and so he told
them. "The gulf of Urabá," said he, "separates
Nueva Andalucía from Castilla del Oro. While on
the eastern side we belonged to the government of
Alonso de Ojeda; now that we are on the western,
we are subject only to Diego de Nicuesa." Before
this simple logic the bachiller was dumfoundered. Of
what value was legal lore that could be so easily overturned
by an illiterate adventurer? In vain he feebly
argued that wherever was Ojeda's colony, Ojeda's
deputy was master. The people were against him;
and the opinion of the people concerning him was
expressed by Vasco Nuñez when some time afterward
he wrote the king regarding persons of that cloth in
infant settlements: "Most powerful sire," he said,
"there is one great favor that I pray your royal highness
to do me, since it is of great importance to your
service. It is for your royal highness to issue an
order that no bachiller of laws, or of anything unless
it be of medicine, shall come to these parts of Tierra
Firme, under a heavy penalty that your highness
shall fix; because no bachiller ever comes hither who
is not a devil, and they all live like devils, and not
only are they themselves bad, but they make others
bad, having always contrivances to bring about litigations
and villainies. This is very important to your
highness' service in this a new country."<a id='FA_VII-6' href='#FN_VII-6' class='fnanchor'>[VII-6]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_330' href='#Page_330'>330</a></span>
</p>

<p>
So the lawyer was deposed, and the cavalier elevated.
Enciso gracelessly yielded his clear authority;
and after much wrangling among the ill-assorted fraternity,
a municipality was decided upon, and two
alcaldes<a id='FA_VII-7' href='#FN_VII-7' class='fnanchor'>[VII-7]</a> were chosen, Vasco Nuñez de Balboa and
Martin Zamudio. The office of regidor<a id='FA_VII-8' href='#FN_VII-8' class='fnanchor'>[VII-8]</a> fell among
others to one Valdivia. Subsequently additional officials
were chosen.
</p>

<p>
Government without law, however, proved no less
ineffectual than law without government. Disaffections
and altercations continued. In the administration
of justice, Balboa was accused of favoring his
friends and frowning upon his enemies. Some repented
having crossed the gulf; some desired the
restoration of Enciso; some suggested that as they
were now within the jurisdiction of Nicuesa, it was
his right to rule, or to name their ruler.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">COLMENARES COMES.</div>

<p>
While these strifes were raging, the inhabitants of
Antigua were startled one day by the report of a gun
coming from the direction of San Sebastian. Thinking
perhaps Ojeda had returned, or sent supplies,
they built fires on the adjacent heights in order to attract
attention. Presently two ships approached, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_331' href='#Page_331'>331</a></span>
anchored before the town. They proved to be vessels
belonging to Nicuesa, freighted at Española with
supplies for the colony of Castilla del Oro, and
commanded by Rodrigo Enriquez de Colmenares.
Thrown by stress of weather upon the coast of Santa
Marta,<a id='FA_VII-9' href='#FN_VII-9' class='fnanchor'>[VII-9]</a> he had there lost a number of his men; after
which he entered the gulf of Urabá, hoping to find
information of Nicuesa.
</p>

<p>
A quick observer and a faithful officer, Colmenares
soon understood the position of affairs, and took
prompt measures to secure to his governor such advantages
as might accrue from profitless contentions.
By a judicious distribution of articles greatly needed
by the colonists, attended by wise counsels, he gained
their confidence, and partly healed their feuds; so
that before sailing he prevailed on them to send two
ambassadors to treat with Nicuesa concerning the
affairs of their settlement. The two envoys chosen
were Diego de Albites, and an aspiring lawyer, hitherto
overshadowed by the august presence of Enciso,
called the bachiller Diego del Corral, and they were
directed to accompany the ships of Colmenares in the
brigantine belonging to the settlement of Antigua.
</p>

<p>
It was about the middle of November, 1510, when
Colmenares entered the gulf of Urabá. Unable to
gather any tidings of Nicuesa, he continued his voyage
westward, searching the inlets along the coast.
He would nevertheless have passed Nombre de Dios
had he not seen some of Nicuesa's men in their
boat, at one of the islands, seeking food. The
wildest joy greeted the new arrival. It was to the
colony of Castilla del Oro as a reprieve from death.
Gazing sadly on the sallow faces and emaciated
forms before them, the miserable wreck of Nicuesa's
gallant company now reduced to sixty souls, listening
to their tales of wretchedness, tears of honest
sympathy fell from the eyes of the hardy sailors.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_332' href='#Page_332'>332</a></span>
With difficulty could be recognized in the leader of
the hapless troop the once gay and courtly Nicuesa.
Colmenares gave the sufferers food and comforted
them. He told Nicuesa of Ojeda's failure, of the
settlement at Antigua, and how Enciso and his company,
having found a spot rich in gold and well provisioned,
had fallen to quarrelling among themselves
about the government, and had finally sent messengers
to him, the rightful ruler, for the healing of
their disputes.
</p>

<p>
To Nicuesa these words were as fresh oil in
an expiring lamp. But in his enfeebled state, the
sudden change from blank despair to brilliant hope
played havoc with his discretion. After brief thanksgiving
for deliverance, his mind became excited by
dreams of boundless wealth and empire. He ordered
a feast, at which he presided with insensate levity.
Toward the ambassadors from the gulf he assumed a
haughty arrogance, claiming supreme authority relative
to all matters at Antigua, and stoutly swearing
that the gold taken from his subjects of Darien should
be disgorged.
</p>

<p>
Colmenares had marked the effect of Nicuesa's
altered temper on his followers. He saw that disaffection
was rife, and that the governor held control
by a feeble thread. Showing Nicuesa the madness of
his course, he explained the importance of attaching
the remnant of Ojeda's colony to his own, and pointed
out their strength and his weakness; he received in
reply only insolent rebukes.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the ambassadors Albites and Corral,
men whose wits were about them, were not pleased
with this foretaste of Nicuesa's rule; nor did intercourse
with Nicuesa's men tend in any wise to diminish
their unfavorable impressions. One night they
visited Lope de Olano, who for his sins was chained
to a rock and made to grind corn. "Behold my condition,"
he exclaimed. "I have ever served my governor
faithfully. I saved him from perishing, when I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_333' href='#Page_333'>333</a></span>
had but to delay his rescue to become myself the
governor. This is my reward. You men of Antigua
may draw your own conclusions." By others
the ambassadors were informed that the chief officers
of the new government were already selected: Vasco
Nuñez was to be stripped of all authority, and Zamudio,
as a relative of Olano, could scarcely hope
to fare better. Those who had trafficked with the
natives were to be severely punished. It was enough.
Stealing away, they hastened back to Antigua. "A
pretty mess you have made of it, with your infernal
bickerings," they said to the assembled confederates.
"Nicuesa will give you more of law than Enciso, and
more of arbitrary rule than Vasco Nuñez and Zamudio
ten times over." A few days after a messenger,
one Juan de Caicedo, arrived from Nicuesa, and informed
them, for their further comfort, that the governor
was detained at one of the islands capturing
natives, but would be with them shortly. Perceiving
that his tidings were not hailed with transports of
joy, and being himself embittered against Nicuesa, as
were indeed almost all his followers, Caicedo swung
round upon his bearings and laughed at them. "Silly
señores! free and rich, you call in a cormorant to
swallow your substance and yourselves." And now,
as usual when folly comes home, curses flowed freely
on themselves and others. The prospect of losing
their gold touched them. What should they do?
</p>

<p>
Once more Vasco Nuñez offers a pertinent suggestion.
"You were dissatisfied with Enciso, and questioned
many of my acts. Now you fear a governor
possessing all the bad qualities of your former rulers,
with, perhaps, few of their redeeming traits. If
calling Nicuesa was an error, is not receiving him a
greater one?" Struck by the suggestion, the colonists
drop their differences and unite as one man against
Nicuesa, each taking a solemn oath never to serve
under him. Sentries are then stationed to give notice
of his approach, and measures taken to prevent his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_334' href='#Page_334'>334</a></span>
landing. After eight days pleasantly passed kidnapping
among the islands, the ill-fated governor
enters the harbor and comes to anchor, little dreaming
of the reception that awaits him. On shore before
the town he observes a company of armed men,
assembled, as he supposes, to give him welcome. As
he prepares to disembark, the public procurator<a id='FA_VII-10' href='#FN_VII-10' class='fnanchor'>[VII-10]</a> advances
and, to his astonishment, in a loud voice warns
him on pain of death not to place foot on shore, but
instantly to abandon these parts and return no more.
</p>

<p>
The colony at Antigua was at this time comparatively
strong and well-conditioned; Nicuesa's followers
were few, weak, and disaffected. For him to enforce
authority was not possible. His mind had dwelt
fondly of late on his rising fortunes, and this hostile
reception was a terrible disappointment, for it was the
last earthly resource. To return to the broken camp
at Nombre de Dios would be to enter again the jaws
of death; if he could not remain here, he certainly
could not depart.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">ILL-TREATMENT OF NICUESA.</div>

<p>
Recovering in a measure, as from a heavy blow,
the governor requested permission to land, promising
solemnly to enter into any stipulations concerning
the government which the colonists should deem
just. His proposals were drowned by the shouts
of the rabble; and he was warned, as he valued his
life, to approach no nearer the shore. Nicuesa continued
his expostulations till nightfall, when he
retired with his ship a little farther from land. Returning
next morning, he renewed his importunities.
A change had apparently taken place in the minds
of the people, for he was now permitted to land
with his page. Balboa received the governor courteously,
conducted him to his house, and made him
a guest for the night. The affairs of the government
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_335' href='#Page_335'>335</a></span>
were discussed, and an amicable understanding
was arrived at by the two leaders. It was nothing
less, in fact, than that one of them should be first,
and the other second, in Castilla del Oro. On the
following day a portion of the crew on board Nicuesa's
ship was permitted to land; and Vasco Nuñez
now endeavored to reconcile his comrades to the rule
of the governor. It was too late. Sedition is more
easily raised than allayed. Not only was Zamudio
jealous of his colleague, but he well knew that under
the proposed regime the odium of all the opposition
would fall on him. Drawing round him the rougher
element, he reminded the colonists of their oath, and
pictured to them the poverty and restraint under
the proposed government. So successful was he in
exciting bad blood, that Nicuesa was glad to escape
insult and violence by retiring to his ship. Thus
encouraged, Zamudio resolved to press a final issue
by capturing the governor, and dictating terms to
him. The next day accordingly he placed his men
in ambush near the landing, and with one companion,
Pedro Macaz, appeared before the ship. Hailing the
commander, he assured him that all was well, and
that he now might safely venture on shore. Nicuesa
fell easily into the trap. Joining the conspirators,
he walked unsuspiciously with them toward the spot
where the gang lay concealed. When near it Zamudio
changed his tone to one of harsh insolence,
"Señor Nicuesa," he said, "why do you persist in
remaining here contrary to our wishes? Your presence
is our ruin. We can neither accept you, nor
abandon this place. You must depart instantly, or
die. Take your choice." Meanwhile his minions
sprang forward. Nicuesa saw it all at a glance. He
was fleet of foot, and this was his only hope. So flinging
off dignity, he eluded their clutches, dashed off at
the top of his speed along the shore, and outstripping
his pursuers, turned into the forest to hide.
</p>

<p>
When Vasco Nuñez saw the desperate plight to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_336' href='#Page_336'>336</a></span>
which Nicuesa was reduced, all the generous impulses
of his nature were aroused. He hated himself for
the part he had played, and cursed the sordid ambition
which thus unjustly humiliated so chivalrous a
gentleman. More in earnest than ever, he sought out
Nicuesa in the wood; and then endeavored to excite
the sympathies of the colonists, and even to intimidate
them; but all was of no avail. Those there
were who well knew they had gone too far ever to be
forgiven.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">SAD FATE OF NICUESA.</div>

<p>
Satan now wholly possessed Zamudio. No fiend
could ever invent and execute a more dastardly measure
than was now proposed. With sixty men he
entered the forest, seized Nicuesa, and made him
swear instantly to sail for Spain, touching no port till
he should reach Cádiz. Then, as if in mockery, he
took from him his only serviceable ship, placed him
into the old brigantine, now rotten and unsafe, which
had been in use at Veragua, and sent him forth with
seventeen men and a few devoted members of his
household. It was in March, 1511, that the so lately
proud and gallant Nicuesa was thus driven from
Antigua, and neither he nor any of that ill-fated
company was ever afterward heard from!<a id='FA_VII-11' href='#FN_VII-11' class='fnanchor'>[VII-11]</a>

<p>
Thus far the first decade of disaster along Tierra
Firme; thus far the discovery of Rodrigo de Bastidas
in 1501; the ineffectual attempt of Columbus at
Veragua in 1502; the failure of the impetuous Ojeda,
and the death of the veteran pilot, Juan de la Cosa;
the founding of Nombre de Dios and Antigua; the
destruction of the superb armament of Diego de Nicuesa,
and the sad fate of its commander. Meanwhile
we behold evolved from the factions of Antigua
two notable characters, Francisco Pizarro and Vasco
Nuñez de Balboa. We will now further observe
society in Darien, and the attempts of the Spaniards
to govern themselves and pacify their neighbors.
</p>

<p>
When Diego de Nicuesa embarked to assume command
at Antigua, he left in the fortress of Nombre
de Dios a small garrison under Gonzalo de Badajoz,
with Alonso Nuñez de Madrid as alcalde. Their provisions
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_338' href='#Page_338'>338</a></span>
falling low, and expected relief failing them,
like ill-mannered wolves they fell to fighting over the
little remaining food, and but for the opportune arrival
of Colmenares, civilization at Nombre de Dios
would soon have found a miserable ending. To the
proposal to join their countrymen at Antigua, they
eagerly assented, and embarked without delay in the
two brigantines sent for the purpose. Lope de Olano
was released, and subsequently rose high in the esteem
of Balboa. Thus the settlement of Antigua, after the
departure of the hapless Nicuesa, comprised all that
was left of the two colonies of Nueva Andalucía and
Castilla del Oro, and numbered about two hundred
and fifty men.<a id='FA_VIII-1' href='#FN_VIII-1' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-1]</a>
</p>

<p>
The final disappearance of the two commanders by
no means allayed the discords of the colony. Factions
assumed broader dimensions than ever. A band of
two hundred and fifty bears, after accomplishing the
duties of the day, would sensibly stretch themselves
under the welcome covert; but intellectual and moral
beasts are, by reason of their superiority, doomed to
the eternal curse of government; nor does it make
much difference as to the quality or quantity of the
herd; fools will fight for domination all the same.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEEP DIPLOMACIES.</div>

<p>
Zamudio, followed by the gang that had driven
out Nicuesa, claims preëminence as a reward for his
villainies. Enciso, the learned and disinterested representative
of the higher orders of mastership, earthly
and heavenly, never fails to keep the high and holy
law spread before these misguided men. Vasco Nuñez
keeps his own counsel; but he feels within himself
that neither Zamudio nor Enciso shall rule Antigua.
All he need do is to continue as hitherto to
turn against his opponents their own weapons. The
lawyer he vanquishes with law; the ruffian, by giving
him a rope wherewith to hang himself. In the
present instance, like a skilful tactician, he separates
his antagonists and opposes one to the other. Calling
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_339' href='#Page_339'>339</a></span>
Zamudio aside, he makes evident to him the
necessity, if he would continue a municipal government,
of withholding all power from the bachiller.
Having no intention of relinquishing the sweets of
office, for which he has risked so much, Zamudio lends
a willing ear. The lawyer must be quieted, but lawfully.
High-handed measures may be employed, but
only exceptionally. The law is too useful a weapon
to be flung aside by intelligent knaves. So the two
alcaldes put their heads together and frame charges
to fit the occasion. Enciso is accused of wilful usurpation
of authority, of assuming the duties and exercising
the functions of alcalde mayor without license
from the king—grave charges, truly, emanating from
so scrupulous a society. The lawyer's skill at pleading
avails him nothing. He is convicted, his property
confiscated, and himself cast into prison.<a id='FA_VIII-2' href='#FN_VIII-2' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-2]</a> He is
not long kept in confinement, however, but is set free
on giving a promise immediately to leave the country.<a id='FA_VIII-3' href='#FN_VIII-3' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-3]</a>
Thus one of the two ambitious Cæsars is out
of the way; but how dispose of the other? Again
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_340' href='#Page_340'>340</a></span>
Vasco Nuñez draws Zamudio aside and expresses a
fear that the enraged bachiller, once in Spain, will
stir up the king against them, and enter false statements
before the tribunal of the Indies regarding the
quality of justice dispensed by the alcaldes of Antigua.
"Would it not be well," continues Balboa,
"for one of us to accompany the bachiller? and thus,
while misrepresentations may be promptly refuted,
we may at the same time secure our government
upon a more substantial basis." Zamudio sees this
necessity, and is finally induced to accept the commission.
Thus Vasco Nuñez is left to reign alone; and
every effort is made by him firmly to secure his government.
While cementing his friends, he conciliates
his enemies; above all he strives to deal justly by
everybody, and with fair success. By caring for their
comfort and exercising strict impartiality in the division
of spoils, he wins the hearts of the fighting
men. Even Oviedo, who was not friendly to Balboa,
says: "No chieftain who ever went to the Indies
equalled him in these respects." And yet, beneath
the accumulating honors the recipient sits not wholly
at ease. "No one need hope to rule this land," writes
Vasco Nuñez to the king, "and sit or sleep; for if he
sleep, he will never wake. Day and night I think
only of your Majesty's interests. In every battle I
lead my men, and with truthful example, and kind
treatment of the natives, seek to bring into favor
your Majesty's government in these parts."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_341' href='#Page_341'>341</a></span>
</p>

<p>
It must not be supposed that the settlers were idle
all this time, or that the natives, or their gold, were
neglected. The town had grown in size and importance
since the driving out of Cemaco. Streets had
been regularly laid out round a <i>plaza</i>,<a id='FA_VIII-4' href='#FN_VIII-4' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-4]</a> or public square,
common to all Spanish towns, and a church and religious
houses established, for priests had come hither
with the rest.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">ENCISO AND THE ALCALDES.</div>

<p>
While Enciso made ready for departure, Bachiller
Corral, Captain Badajoz, and others, enemies of Balboa,
improved the time by secretly making specifications
of both the alcaldes' errors, and by instigating
others to assist in criminating the rulers. These
charges were to be delivered to the king by Enciso.
Hearing of it, the alcaldes seized the ringleaders and
confined them in a pen,<a id='FA_VIII-5' href='#FN_VIII-5' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-5]</a> the municipal jail, situated in
the middle of the plaza. But the prisoners escaped
from the cage to the Franciscan monastery, and, claiming
the protection of the sanctuary,<a id='FA_VIII-6' href='#FN_VIII-6' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-6]</a> they were finally
discharged.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_342' href='#Page_342'>342</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Valdivia, the regidor, was Balboa's friend; before
leaving the Salvatierra plantation they had been
warmly intimate. Supplies were needed, and Enciso
and Zamudio required passage to Spain. Taking,
therefore, a small vessel, and placing in Valdivia's
hands a large amount of gold,<a id='FA_VIII-7' href='#FN_VIII-7' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-7]</a> Vasco Nuñez sent him
to Española, with instructions to buy the good opinion
of Diego Colon the governor, and Pasamonte<a id='FA_VIII-8' href='#FN_VIII-8' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-8]</a> the
king's treasurer, and bring back recruits. The regidor
was fairly successful. He set forth the wealth
of Tierra Firme, and the important services of Vasco
Nuñez in glowing colors, and obtained from the governor
a commission authorizing Balboa to act as his
lieutenant in those parts. He begged for his friend
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_343' href='#Page_343'>343</a></span>
Pasamonte's influence with the king; but Enciso was
active there with opposing influence.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Meanwhile Balboa was haunted by thoughts not
of the happiest. He well knew how precarious was
his tenure of position. Nicuesa's wrongs were ever
before him. Though not the chief criminal in that
affair, he knew he was criminal enough. Yet before
the deed was done, and since, he had striven to make
amends. "Once, twice, three times," writes he to the
king, "have I sent aid to Nicuesa's men, and saved
them when dying at the rate of five and six a day."
Then, too, he must confess having treated poor Enciso
somewhat shamefully; and the bachiller was stronger
where there was more strength in the law; while Zamudio
was not the same before the king as before his
Antigua ruffians. There remained only one course.
Action was the word. If he would play the great
man, and rule others, he must bestir himself to something
nobler than political strife and demagogy at
Antigua. Gold would help him; he thoroughly appreciated
the weakness of officials in that direction;
but a notable adventure, a great discovery, were better.
At all events, upon whatever he should decide, he must
act immediately, before being deprived of his present
modicum of authority.
</p>

<p>
First of all, he would begin his career of greatness
by assuming to be great. One is never nearer the
truth than when one puts on humility and curses one's
self for an ass. Without offensive ostentation he assumed
becoming forms of dignity, took upon himself
the title of governor, appointed officers, and drilled
soldiers in the tactics of Indian warfare.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">BATTLE WITH CEMACO.</div>

<p>
Some twenty leagues westerly from Antigua, adjoining
the lands of Cemaco, was an Indian province
called Coiba, of which Careta<a id='FA_VIII-9' href='#FN_VIII-9' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-9]</a> was chief. The governor,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_344' href='#Page_344'>344</a></span>
being informed that Careta was rich in gold
and maize, despatched thither a small company under
Pizarro, whom he had made captain. They were
hardly on the march before Cemaco was encountered,
at the head of four hundred men, all fired, like their
chief, with ever-living rage. Never for an hour since
the strangers landed to seize their homes had the
eyes of the savages been removed from them. It
was hopeless to fight, naked as they were; yet for
what had they to live, with houses and lands and
all their property taken from them? The mode of
warfare, too, was against the natives; they did not
fight here, as at San Sebastian, with poisoned arrows
shot from behind rocks and trees, but engaged in hand-to-hand
conflict, opposing their defenceless bodies to
the steel weapons of the Spaniards, on whose coats
of mail their darts and clubs fell harmless. A fight
ensued nevertheless, and fiercely it was waged. It is
somewhat difficult to believe Herrera when he says
that Pizarro had with him but six men, who, when
the four hundred closed with them, eviscerated one
hundred and fifty savages, and put the remainder to
flight. Hastening back to Antigua, leaving one man
wounded on the field, Pizarro stood before the governor
exhausted and bleeding. Balboa's anger at the
desertion overpowered for a moment his admiration
for the desperate courage displayed by the little band,
and turning to Pizarro, he said sharply, "Go instantly
and bring me Francisco Hernan, and, as you value
your life, never again leave one of my soldiers alive
upon a field of battle." Pizarro departed, and soon
returned with his disabled comrade. Balboa immediately
placed himself at the head of a hundred men,
and started in pursuit of Cemaco, determined to extirpate
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_345' href='#Page_345'>345</a></span>
the tribe; but, after ascending the river for
some distance and finding no enemy, he abandoned
pursuit. Scarcely had he returned, when the two
brigantines sent to Nombre de Dios for the remainder
of Nicuesa's men made their appearance at Antigua.
They brought no news of Nicuesa, greatly to the disappointment
of Balboa, who would now gladly have
fortified himself in a less elevated position, and placed
Antigua under the banner of the lawful governor of
the territory.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">EXPEDITION AGAINST CARETA.</div>

<p>
Fresh accounts of the wealth of Coiba, by this arrival,
soon dispelled the governor's misgivings, and turned
his thoughts in other directions. It seems that as the
vessels were returning from Nombre de Dios, they
touched the shore of Coiba; and while there were
greeted by two painted savages in plain Castilian.
The riddle was solved when the men told them they
were gentlemen renegades, escaped from Nicuesa's
colony for fear of punishment for misdemeanor. After
long and dangerous wanderings in the wilderness, they
had thrown themselves, half-dead, upon the mercy of
Careta, who received them with gentle courtesy,
bestowing food and every kindness, which they were
now ready to requite by betraying to the Spaniards
the cacique's treasures, for he was very rich.
</p>

<p>
To this act of treachery the Spanish yielded a
prompt compliance, and were ready for the adventure
on the instant. Owing to their present weak condition
Colmenares advised delay, and arranged that one
of the miscreants should go with them to Antigua,
while the other remained with Careta in readiness
to betray him at the proper time. Nor had the governor
the least scruple in availing himself of this villainy.
With one hundred and thirty men he marched
on Coiba, directing the two brigantines to meet him
there. Acting under the direction of the fugitive
whom he had made his confidant and counsellor,
Careta went out to meet the Spaniards, brought them
to his village, and entertained them to the best of his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_346' href='#Page_346'>346</a></span>
ability. Balboa began with the modest request for
maize to fill his ships. Careta answered, that owing
to war with his ever hostile neighbor, Ponca, he had
this year planted nothing, and hence had no surplus.
Careta's Spanish friend assured his countrymen that
this was false, that the savage had abundance. It was
enough. A heathen had lied to a Christian. Let the
nation be anathema!
</p>

<p>
Bidding the chief a friendly farewell, with thanks
for his hospitality, the Spaniards took their departure
as if for Antigua; but about midnight they returned,
attacked the village on three sides, slaughtered the
inhabitants, burned the houses, loaded the brigantines
with booty, and carried Careta and his family
prisoners to Antigua. "Why should you do this?"
asked Careta. "How have I wronged you? Take my
gold, but restore me to my country. And as a pledge
of my good faith, there is my daughter who shall
remain a hostage in your hands. Take her and let
us be friends." The proposal pleased the governor,
not less from the advantage of the alliance, than
from the influence thrown over him by the charms
of the dusky maiden, for she was very beautiful, and
had already given her heart to the Christian chieftain.
And thus according to the usage of her people she
became his wife, though not wedded after the Spanish
fashion; and Vasco Nuñez ever cherished her with
fond affection.
</p>

<p>
Before dismissing the new allies with presents to
their homes, care was taken to excite their admiration
by showing them the arms and implements of civilization,
and unfolding to them the doctrines of the true
faith. These doctrines must have appeared in strange
contrast to the blood-thirsty deeds of the Spaniards.
</p>

<p>
A joint expedition against Ponca, in which Balboa
participated with eighty men, overran that chieftain's
domain with great damage to him, and with some
gain to the Spaniards in provisions and gold.
</p>

<p>
Adjoining Careta's lands, on the seaboard to the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_347' href='#Page_347'>347</a></span>
west, were those of Comagre,<a id='FA_VIII-10' href='#FN_VIII-10' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-10]</a> whose nation numbered
ten thousand souls, and mustered three thousand
warriors. Balboa visited him peaceably, upon the
arrangement of a friendly interview by a native <i>jura</i>,
or official, a deserter from Careta's council, who had
become offended with his master, and joined Comagre.
The jura was a statesman in a rude way, and a diplomat.
He knew of the Spaniards, of their fearful
doings, and of their alliance with Careta; and being
an honest, well-meaning savage withal, he thought to
avert disaster by interposing friendly relations.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">PANCIACO'S STORY.</div>

<p>
With a train of attendants, Comagre met his distinguished
guest, and with much ceremony conducted
him to the palace,<a id='FA_VIII-11' href='#FN_VIII-11' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-11]</a> which for size, durability, and
rude excellence, far exceeded anything the Spaniards
had seen in the New World. Among the numerous
descendants of Comagre, for he was much married,
were seven sons, remarkable for their valor,
and nobleness of demeanor. The eldest, Panciaco,
united with a haughty bearing exceptional sagacity.
He saw at once the superiority of steel weapons;
he saw that the Spaniards coveted gold; and he
thought he saw an easy way open for purchasing
their good-will. Collecting four thousand ounces of
the metal finely wrought, he presented it with seventy
slaves to the Spaniards, and watched the effect. The
king's fifth was first solemnly set aside. Then they
began to divide the remainder of the gold among themselves;
and in this division arose a dispute which made
Panciaco's lip curl in scorn as he watched them weighing
the stuff. Louder grew their altercations, which were
followed by blows. Overcome at length by disgust,
Panciaco darted forward and struck the scales a violent
blow which sent their precious contents flying. "Why
quarrel for such a trifle!" he exclaimed. "Is it for this
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_348' href='#Page_348'>348</a></span>
you leave your country, cross seas, endure hardships,
and disturb the peace of nations? Cease your voracious
brawl and I will tell where you may obtain your
fill of gold. Six days' march across yon mountain
will bring you to an ocean sea, like this near which
we dwell, where there are ships as large as yours, and
cities, and wealth unbounded."
</p>

<p>
Forgetting in the matter the manner of the discourse,
the Spaniards listened with eager attention.
"How say you?" said Vasco Nuñez. "What proof
have you of this?" "Listen to me," replied Panciaco.
"You Christians seem to prize this metal more than
body, life, or soul; more than love, hate, revenge.
Some mysterious virtue it must possess to charm men
so! We who can not translate its subtle power, love
better friends, and sweet revenge. My father has
an ancient enemy, Tubanamá, who lives beyond the
mountains fronting the other sea. From time immemorial
our people have fought his people; many
have been killed on either side, and many enslaved.
Could we for once bring low this hated Tubanamá,
no sacrifice would be too dear. Be yours the gold;
give us revenge. The path is difficult, the enemy
fierce. One thousand Spaniards are none too many
successfully to cope with him. Prepare your army.
I myself will accompany you with all the warriors
of our nation; bind me fast; keep me in close custody;
and if my words prove false, hang me to the
nearest tree."<a id='FA_VIII-12' href='#FN_VIII-12' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-12]</a> Vasco Nuñez pondered. The area
of his destiny seemed suddenly to have enlarged. If
this the young man had said were true, and he might
tap the mystery, and bring to the light of nations this
other side of Tierra Firme, the temporary governor
of a handful of heterogeneous colonists might achieve
everlasting fame as one of the world's great discoverers,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_349' href='#Page_349'>349</a></span>
and realize the dream of Columbus, to rule the
Aurea Chersonesus of King Solomon. To him who
can execute comes opportunity. "God has revealed
the secrets of this land to me only," he piously writes
the 20th of January, 1513, "and for this I never shall
cease to thank him." But whence were to come the
requisite one thousand men? After closely interrogating
Comagre, Careta, and other chieftains concerning
the tramontane regions, the Spaniards returned to
Darien; but not until many of the natives had renounced
idolatry and received baptism at the hands
of the priests. There they found Valdivia returned
from Santo Domingo, after an absence of six months,
with a small store of provisions, and what was of the
highest consequence to Vasco Nuñez at this juncture,
the commission from Diego Colon as governor of
Antigua.
</p>

<p>
To guard against the scarcity of food which had
thus far been one of the chief causes of failure in every
attempt to colonize Tierra Firme, the governor had
this year caused to be planted a large tract adjacent to
Antigua, the labor of course being performed by captives.
"Food has been our great necessity rather than
gold," said Vasco Nuñez in a letter to the king. But
a hurricane, followed by inundation, destroyed the
crop, and Valdivia was again sent with the caravel to
Santo Domingo for provisions. In a letter to Diego
Colon, the governor set forth in extravagant terms
his further knowledge of the country, dwelling upon
the information received of a great sea to the southward,
and begging assistance in raising a thousand
men for its discovery. Gold to the value of fifteen
thousand pesos<a id='FA_VIII-13' href='#FN_VIII-13' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-13]</a> was, by this departure, remitted the
king's officers as the royal share for the last six
months. Large sums were also sent by private persons
to their friends and creditors in Española and
Spain. But all to no end. For when near Jamaica,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_350' href='#Page_350'>350</a></span>
the vessel was struck by a squall, carried westward,
and thrown on some rocks off Yucatan. Ship and
cargo were all lost. Twenty men, without water, or
food, or sail, or oars, in an open boat, escaped with
bare life.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">HORRIBLE FATE OF VALDIVIA.</div>

<p class="p2">
And now comes another tale of wretchedness which
might well grace the annals of Acheron. In their
helpless condition they are carried by the currents for
thirteen days; one third of their number die of thirst,
and the survivors drift to a yet more horrible fate.
Thrown on the Maya shore, they are seized by savages,
placed in a pen, and well fed. After their sufferings
at sea, this is not so bad; but one day Valdivia and
four others are taken to the temple and sacrificed,
and their roasted limbs eaten in honor of the gods;
over which prospect for themselves the survivors are
uncomfortable, and nerved by desperation, they break
cage and escape to the forest, where they wander naked
and starving until life is a burden. Then they cast
themselves at the feet of Ahkin Xooc, cacique of
Jamancana, neighbor and enemy of the Maya lord.
He and his successor, Taxmar, make them serve as
beasts of burden until two only are left alive, Gonzalo
Guerrero, sailor, and Gerónimo de Aguilar, friar. In
an interchange of captives, the sailor becomes the
property of Nachan Kan, chief of Chetumal. Bold
and buoyant-hearted, he rises to barbaric distinction,
becomes a great general, marries a princess, and in
after years, when opportunity offers, declines return
to civilized life. The friar is rescued by Cortés, in
1519, in which connection we shall again meet him.<a id='FA_VIII-14' href='#FN_VIII-14' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-14]</a>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">DABAIBA AND ITS GOLDEN TEMPLE.</div>

<p class="p2">
Cannibals are horrible things; but their teeth were
hardly so sharp as Spanish steel, which, in following
the law of survival common to the animal kingdom,
was sacrificing freely about Antigua at this time.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_351' href='#Page_351'>351</a></span>
"Thirty caciques have already been slain in the attempted
pacification of this country," writes Vasco
Nuñez to Diego Colon, "and now that I am obliged
to penetrate still further in search of food, I must
kill all who fall into my hands; otherwise our colony
can not exist while waiting relief." In pursuance
of this humane measure, early in 1512—it was
toward the close of 1511 that Valdivia had sailed
for Española—the governor organized an expedition
against Dabaiba,<a id='FA_VIII-15' href='#FN_VIII-15' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-15]</a> a rich province some thirty leagues
to the southward.
</p>

<p>
Startling stories were told of this place. At a
temple lined with gold, slaves were sacrificed for the
gratification of the gods, who returned in miracles the
favors of their worshippers; so that Dabaiba became
as Mecca in the wilderness. Of course, it was an
outrage against heaven that the heathen gods should
have so much gold and glory; though hunger and
avarice lent as much assistance, perhaps, as piety, in
instigating the contemplated raid.
</p>

<p>
Selecting one hundred and sixty men, Vasco Nuñez
embarked in two brigantines for the mouths of the
river.<a id='FA_VIII-16' href='#FN_VIII-16' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-16]</a> There he divided his force, sending one third,
under Colmenares, up the channel San Juan, while
with the remainder he ascended the Rio de las Redes,
the more direct route to Dabaiba, as he had been
informed. But the eye of Cemaco, in restless
hate, was still upon them. Rousing the country, he
induced the caciques along the river to retire, and
leave wasted fields to the invaders, a measure which
defeated the expedition. Nevertheless, the Spaniards
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_352' href='#Page_352'>352</a></span>
secured, a short distance up the river, two canoe-loads
of plunder, valued at seven thousand pesos, but on
reaching the gulf they were overturned in a storm, and
the boatmen drowned. Balboa then proceeded to the
Rio San Juan and joined Colmenares, after which the
entire party ascended the Negro channel for six leagues,
and captured a town of five hundred houses, governed
by a cacique named Abenamechey, one of whose arms
a Spaniard cruelly struck off after he had been made
prisoner. Leaving there half the men in charge of
Colmenares, with the remainder Balboa continued his
ascent of the stream, until, on entering a small branch,
he found himself within the domain of Abibeiba, whose
people built their houses in the branches of palm trees,
making the ascent by ladders drawn up at night for
safety. A supply of stones was kept in the houses for
artillery purposes. When they saw the Spaniards
coming, the people ran like squirrels for their houses,
and drawing up after them the ladders, fancied themselves
in security.
</p>

<p>
Approaching the tree in which lived the chief,
Balboa hailed him and ordered him down. "What
brings you hither to molest me?" demanded the chief.
"Go your way. I know you not as friends or foes.
I have no gold. I desire only to be left in peace."
The Spaniards answered by applying the axe to the
tree, and when the chief saw the chips fly, while his
stone showers fell harmless upon the mail-coated men
below, he capitulated, and the village descended to
earth.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">A CONSPIRACY DIVULGED.</div>

<p>
After further foraging and fighting with varied
success, the governor returned to Antigua, leaving
Bartolomé Hurtado with thirty-one men in possession
of the country. Of these more than half fell sick, and
Hurtado incautiously despatched them for Antigua
with twenty-four captives in charge. They had not
proceeded more than three leagues before Cemaco
was upon them with one hundred warriors; and of
the Spaniards only two escaped to carry the news to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_353' href='#Page_353'>353</a></span>
Hurtado, who hastened to Antigua with the further
intelligence that five caciques, namely, Abibeiba of the
high-tree house, Abenamechy of the severed arm,
Dabaiba of the golden temple, Abraiba and Cemaco
of Darien, had confederated with five thousand men
to exterminate the Spaniards. The rumor was lightly
regarded until Vasco Nuñez was informed by one of
his mistresses, Fulvia he called her, that her brother
had notified her to withdraw from the town on a
certain night, so that she might not fall in the massacre
intended. Love overruling duty, Fulvia thus
divulged the secret. She saved the settlement, but
she lost her country.
</p>

<p>
Poor heart of woman touched with love! Vasco
Nuñez induced Fulvia to lure thither her brother,
who thereupon was seized and forced to confess the
plot. Furthermore, he told Balboa that then at work
in his fields were forty men long pledged to assassinate
him, but as he had always appeared before them armed
and armored, and on a caparisoned horse, which was
their greatest terror, they had feared to attack him.
The rendezvous of the conspirators was Tichirí, not
far distant. With seventy men, by a circuitous route,
Balboa marched on the encampment, while Colmenares
with an equal force ascended the river in canoes,
guided by the traitress Fulvia's traitorous brother.
Attacked thus unexpectedly from opposite sides, the
confederates were thrown into confusion; many were
killed and many taken prisoners. The chief general
was honored by being shot to death with arrows,
while the others were hanged. Cemaco escaped. So
sudden and bold and severe was this blow, that, while
Antigua existed, the savages never recovered from it,
and the wooden fortress which Balboa immediately
built as a guard against future surprise was scarcely
necessary.
</p>

<p>
The natives being thus pacified, the Spaniards were
at liberty to evolve fresh projects. Gold and grain
in the vicinity of Antigua were well-nigh exhausted,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_354' href='#Page_354'>354</a></span>
and new fields must be found. The time for Valdivia's
return had elapsed; and doubts respecting the
integrity of the regidor were entertained by Vasco
Nuñez, with fears for the safety of his treasure. Unable
to endure the suspense he resolved on visiting
Spain and pleading his own cause before the king.
But the colony demurred. Friends declared his presence
necessary, while enemies saw danger in his absence.
It was finally arranged that Colmenares and
Caicedo, both worthy men who had been faithful to
Nicuesa as long as Nicuesa had been faithful to himself,
and faithful to Vasco Nuñez, should take the
only remaining vessel fit for service and embark for
Spain in the general interests of the colony. The
reasoning by which the mistrustful populace arrived
at this agreement was, that if Balboa went he would
secure all the advantages to himself, or never return;
while Colmenares, who left large property in lands and
laborers, and Caicedo, a genuine Spanish wife to whom
he was devotedly attached, would be sure to return.
</p>

<p>
Again the governor wrote Pasamonte soliciting his
favor; not forgetting, in addition to the king's fifth,
a valuable present in gold for the king's treasurer.
The commissioners sailed from Darien in October,
1512, and reached Spain the May following.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Meanwhile times at Antigua ran their varying
course. At first nothing of interest occurred; and
such were the composite elements of this society that
inactivity invariably resulted in spontaneous combustion.
Again it centred round the ruling powers.
"Who is this Vasco Nuñez that he should lord it
over us? a renegade! an absconding debtor! he of
the cask!" The immediate cause of the outbreak
was the investiture of Hurtado, an unpopular person,
with authority; and the more specific charges were
partiality in the division of spoils, and the unlawful
assumption of powers pertaining to a royally appointed
ruler.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_355' href='#Page_355'>355</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The new faction was led by one Alonso Perez de
la Rua, who for fancied insult pawed the earth and
bellowed vengeance. The agitation becoming troublesome
Perez was arrested and placed in confinement.
The insurgents rushed to arms and demanded the
release of their leader, and this being denied they
prepared to rescue him by force. The governor placed
himself at the head of his adherents, and the two
parties prepared for battle. At this juncture peaceful
measures were interposed by a third party, consisting
of those who had taken no active part in the
disputes, and embracing many respectable colonists.
Perez was released; but the gnawings of hate continuing
he roused his party and made prisoner Hurtado,
who in his turn was given liberty at the hands
of the conciliators.
</p>

<p>
Chivalry having had its brief day, avarice came in for
a share of public attention. Among the yet undivided
plunder was gold obtained in the late Atrato River
raids, equivalent in value to ten thousand castellanos.
Of this the disaffected demanded immediate division.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE GOVERNOR WITHDRAWS.</div>

<p>
The governor well knew that in their present mood
it was beyond the power of man to satisfy them.
Though omniscient justice distributed this treasure,
new troubles would grow out of it. He determined
therefore to adopt a non-committal policy, retire from
the scene, and freely give them the opportunity, for
which they were so ready, to shed blood. Quitting
the town at night, ostensibly on a hunting tour, he remained
away for several days, leaving them to their
destruction. The result was as he had anticipated.
Finding themselves free the rioters elevated to the
command Perez of the wounded honor, and Bachiller
Corral. Then breaking into the public plunder-house,
they brought out the gold and placed it in the hands
of their leaders for distribution. Proof that the division
was fair lay in the fact that every one was dissatisfied.
Each, rating his own services superior to most and
inferior to none, thought he received too little and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_356' href='#Page_356'>356</a></span>
another too much. They began to suspect their mistake.
A dim perception of the infelicities that mix
with the rapturous sweets of governing entered their
stolid brains. Balboa's party quickly assumed the
ascendency, and thrusting the ringleaders of the insurgents
into prison they awaited the return of the governor.
</p>

<p>
"Your highness must know," writes Vasco Nuñez
of this affair to the king, January 20, 1513, "that some
days ago little differences occurred here, because the
alcaldes, filled with envy and falsehood, attempted
to arrest me. Failing in this they brought against
me false accusations and false witnesses. Hereof I
complain to your highness, for if these men go unpunished,
no governor that your highness may hereafter
send will be free from this evil. That your
highness may know the truth in the matter, and
of my great and loyal services in these parts of the
Indies and Tierra Firme, I have appointed two judges
to investigate my conduct, and report to your majesty
all that I have done. I hope," concludes the modest
cavalier, "that your majesty will read all this, and
reward my great services according to their value."
</p>

<p class="p2">
About this time there arrived at Antigua two
vessels, in command of Cristóbal Serrano, sent by
Diego Colon, with one hundred and fifty men and
provisions for the colony. But what gave Vasco
Nuñez the greatest joy was a royal commission,
signed by Pasamonte, the treasurer, investing him
with the supreme command of the colony. Thus
established in authority, and being of a generous
temper, the governor at the solicitations of their
friends readily pardoned the rebels and set them at
liberty.
</p>

<p>
Another communication, however, which Vasco
Nuñez received by this arrival, caused him no little
anxiety. This was a letter from Zamudio informing
him of his failure to conciliate the royal favor. As
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_357' href='#Page_357'>357</a></span>
had been feared, the bachiller Enciso, burning under
a sense of injuries, had denounced the alcaldes before
the Council of the Indies, and aroused the king's
wrath by a recital of Nicuesa's banishment and probable
death. The Council had decreed that Enciso
should be indemnified, and that Vasco Nuñez should
be summoned to court to answer graver charges.
Moreover, Zamudio with difficulty escaped the arrest
imposed on him by the Council.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">BALBOA'S RESOLVE.</div>

<p>
This was as wormwood in Balboa's cup of joy.
Yet it was not wholly unexpected; it was not wholly
unmerited. There was one redeeming feature about
it; the intelligence was private. He was still master
of himself; ay, and governor of the colony. Might
not some signal service be made to cover his transgressions,
and win for him the royal favor? There
was that mysterious sea to the southward, reported
by Panciaco. The very thing, were men and means
at hand for its achievement. Means! There was no
time to talk of means; the next arrival would bring a
warrant for his arrest. Do it without means, and so
gain glory the more. Where was the true Spanish
cavalier who would hesitate in such an emergency?
Why, the very danger itself was a fascination. He
would do it or die!

<p>
Revolving matters in his mind, plans quickly unfolded.
Winning for the project a few staunch friends,
Vasco Nuñez selected with great care one hundred
and ninety men.<a id='FA_IX-1' href='#FN_IX-1' class='fnanchor'>[IX-1]</a> More could have been taken, but
he had determined on a rapid march of discovery
rather than pacification and occupation. Hence he
preferred only tried men, those inured to fatigue,
men resolute and reckless, with heart and head hard,
and sinews of steel. He also provided from among
his captives and the neighboring nations one thousand
natives, to serve as warriors and beasts of burden.
These, might live or die, as it should happen: no great
matter what became of them. A pack of bloodhounds
completed the company.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">EMBARKATION OF THE EXPEDITION.</div>

<p>
The men were armed with crossbows, swords, arquebuses
and targets, and provisions for the expedition
were placed on board a brigantine and ten large
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_359' href='#Page_359'>359</a></span>
canoes. Before embarking, the hazardous nature
of the enterprise was made known to the soldiers.
Wealth and glory awaited success; the reward of
failure, death; opportunity was then offered for any
one to withdraw without prejudice or injury.
</p>

<p>
Sailing with his little armament from Antigua on
the first day of September, 1513, Vasco Nuñez de
Balboa followed the coast of Darien north-westward to
Careta's province, where the expedition disembarked
on the fourth day. The chieftain's dusky daughter,
whom the governor continued to regard with great
affection, was still a bond of friendship between this
nation and the Spaniards. Careta added to their stock
of provisions and furnished them with guides; and
some of his warriors joined the expedition, in the hope
of witnessing the downfall of their enemies beyond
the mountains. The boats were left in charge of a
guard; and after invoking divine favor the expedition
was ready to move.
</p>

<p class="p2">
I know the tendency of the historian, warmed by
his theme, to magnify merit, and the obstacles it overcomes;
and I have elsewhere said as much. While
I endeavor to confine myself to the plain words of a
simple story, those who have sat at ease, sipping iced
champagne, during a delightful ride of three or four
hours across this sometime terrible neck, may find in
this chapter expressions appearing strong. But I
do assure the reader that it is difficult to magnify in
the present instance. Vasco Nuñez now stood on
the northern coast, opposite the gulf of San Miguel,
which, breaking the shore of Panamá Bay, narrows
the isthmus of Darien to a width of fifty miles.<a id='FA_IX-2' href='#FN_IX-2' class='fnanchor'>[IX-2]</a> But
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_360' href='#Page_360'>360</a></span>
such is the infamous character of the country, that
even modern efforts to penetrate the unexplored interior
from either side have met disaster and ruin.<a id='FA_IX-3' href='#FN_IX-3' class='fnanchor'>[IX-3]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_361' href='#Page_361'>361</a></span>
Inaccessible forests filled with noxious reptiles and
wild beasts, tangled jungles through which man must
cut his way foot by foot; rugged mountains, slippery
slopes, and rocky precipices, over and round which
the weary traveller threads his way under a blooming
tropical canopy; frequent and sudden rains and inundations;
treacherous morasses, and the malarious exhalations
from putrid vegetation, unite with warlike
savages to render this spot one of the most difficult
on the globe to explore. Add to these obstructions
the weight of heavy armor and cumbrous weapons,
and some conception may be formed of a military
march through an equatorial wilderness.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">QUALITY OF THE BAND.</div>

<p>
No wonder Vasco Nuñez scrutinized his company
before starting. "I beg your very royal Highness,"
he had written before this to the king, "to give me
men from Española; for such as come from Castile
are for my purpose worthless, bringing loss not only
on themselves but others."<a id='FA_IX-4' href='#FN_IX-4' class='fnanchor'>[IX-4]</a> Born amidst the clash
of arms in chivalrous Spain, broken to adversity at
Española, and many of them toughened at Santa
Marta, Veragua, and Antigua, the present band
mustered the survivors of daring expeditions whose
bones strewed the shores of Tierra Firme.
</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>
The Spaniards began their march on the 6th of September.
The second day brought them to the lands
of Ponca, who having been warned of their approach
had retired from the path.<a id='FA_IX-5' href='#FN_IX-5' class='fnanchor'>[IX-5]</a> But other thoughts than
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_362' href='#Page_362'>362</a></span>
those of plunder and petty warfare now filled the
mind of Vasco Nuñez; and, preferring to leave no
enemy in his rear, while resting in the cacique's comfortable
quarters he made overtures of friendship to
the chief, who straightway returned from his hiding,
and gave gold, together with valuable information
concerning the southern sea and the route thither in
return for beads, mirrors, hawk-bells, and axes. For
none knew better than the courteous governor how
to kindle friendship in the savage breast, and make it
profitable. The gold which Ponca gave consisted of
finely wrought ornaments from beyond the mountains,
and ten pounds of the metal from his own mines.
He described a certain summit from which this
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_363' href='#Page_363'>363</a></span>
southern sea might easily be seen, gave information
of the nations to be encountered by the Spaniards,
and furnished them with guides for the secret passes.
</p>

<p>
Roused by this encouragement, and leaving here
the sick and wayworn, the Spaniards were on their
southward march again the 20th of September. Between
the several provinces were no beaten paths,
across the rivers no bridges; so great were the impediments
to their progress, and so much more time was
consumed than had been anticipated, that food began
to fail.
</p>

<p>
Making their way amid these difficulties, they came
to the foot of the high mountains where terminated
their pacified territory, and where they must prepare
to dispute the way with native sovereigns of the soil.
Ascending the mountains, they encountered on the
24th a cacique named Porque, lord of the province of
Quarequá, the ruler of these parts, whose arrogance,
fed by his successes, had kept full pace with them.
At the head of a thousand warriors, Porque appeared
before Vasco Nuñez, demanded the object of his visit,
and threatened to kill every man who should put foot
within his dominions. The Spaniards nevertheless
continued slowly to advance, keeping well together.
Amazed at their temerity, and indignant at the seeming
indifference to his threat, Porque swept down
upon them with flourish of weapons and terrific
yells, confident of easy victory. But as well might
he have spent his unleavened force against the eternal
hills.
</p>

<p>
Waiting until the whole swarm was well within
reach, Vasco Nuñez gave the order to charge. Shouting
the inspiriting war-cry, Santiago, y á ellos! the
Spaniards sprang upon them. The fire-arms were discharged,
the bloodhounds<a id='FA_IX-6' href='#FN_IX-6' class='fnanchor'>[IX-6]</a> let loose, and striking the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_364' href='#Page_364'>364</a></span>
cruel steel into the naked bodies of the enemy, he was
literally hewn in pieces. Vainly, in wild confusion, the
savages struggled to escape; the flash of fire, the thundering
noise, the sulphurous smoke, bereft them of
their senses, making easy work for the sharp iron
which entered unresisted their vitals, until six hundred
lay dead upon the ground, Porque among the
number. Many prisoners were taken; the survivors
escaped to the hills. In the village of Quarequá was
found much needed food, and some gold. So toilsome
had been the march that eighteen days had passed
since leaving Careta's town. And here Vasco Nuñez
rested for the night, nursing his wounded, and
cheering the sick and down-hearted. The guides
whom Ponca had furnished, and who had proved of
incalculable service to the explorers, were dismissed to
their home with presents, and with hearts made glad
by the destruction of Porque. So rolls round the
planet inexorable nature, detested death giving hourly
joy to universal life.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">FIRST VIEW OF THE SOUTH SEA.</div>

<p class="p2">
The 25th<a id='FA_IX-7' href='#FN_IX-7' class='fnanchor'>[IX-7]</a> of September, 1513, a day ever memorable
in the annals of the Pacific States, dawned
brightly over the sierra of Quarequá. The village in
which the Spaniards had made their quarters was situated
on an elevated plateau, and near it rose the
reputed mountain whose summit had for ages gazed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_365' href='#Page_365'>365</a></span>
on the mysterious southern sea. At an early hour
Vasco Nuñez was astir, to prepare with thrilling
anticipations for the ascent. But sixty-seven, out
of the one hundred and ninety Spaniards who within
the month had embarked upon this enterprise at
Antigua, possessed sufficient strength for the present
effort. Departing from the town, their way at first
lay through a tangled forest, which fringed the mountain
base, and whose dense foliage hid from view the
more distant objects. As they mounted upward into
a cooler, drier atmosphere, the vegetation became
more stunted, yet the undergrowth was still so thick
that the soldiers had to cut a passage with their
sabres. Emerging at length into an open space near
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_366' href='#Page_366'>366</a></span>
the summit, a bare eminence was pointed out by the
guides, whence the view was said to be unobstructed,
and the sea distinctly visible.
</p>

<p>
Viewed prosaically, there was nothing astounding
in ascending a hill and taking a look at the ocean.
It had been often done elsewhere; it had been often
done here. Nor was there any peculiar difference
between sea and land here and sea and land elsewhere.
But there was that to the minds of the impetuous
and impressible Spaniards, there is that to our own
minds, in first things and first views of things, our
first view, our country's first awakening, that stirs
the soul and sets faster beating the heart. Reduced
to words, the sentiment is the pleasure the mind
derives from improving surprises; it is the joy of
development, the ecstasy of evolution.
</p>

<p>
If such be commonly the case, how much more
reason had Vasco Nuñez de Balboa to be impassioned
on this occasion. Behind him was ignominy, perhaps
chains and death; before him was glory, immortal
fame. And it was meet in him that this ordinarily
trivial act should be consummated with a ceremony
becoming to one of civilization's great achievements.
</p>

<p>
Ordering a halt, Vasco Nuñez advanced alone. His
should be the first European eye to behold what there
was to behold, and that without peradventure. With
throbbing heart he mounted the topmost eminence
which crowned these sea-dividing hills. Then, as in
the lifting of a veil, a scene of primeval splendor burst
on his enraptured gaze, such as might fill with joy an
archangel sent to explore a new creation. There it
lay, that boundless unknown sea, spread out before
him, far as the eye could reach, in calm, majestic
beauty, glittering like liquid crystal in the morning
sun. Beneath his feet, in furrowed prospect, were
terraces of living green, sportive with iridescent light
and shade; waving plains and feathered steeps white-lined
with flowing waters, here dashing boisterously
down the hill-side, yonder winding silent through the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_367' href='#Page_367'>367</a></span>
sighing foliage to the all-receiving sea. In that first
illimitable glance time stood back, the mists lifted,
and eternity was there. What wonder if to this
Spanish cavalier, in that moment of triumphant joy,
visions of the mighty future appeared pictured on the
cerulean heights, visions of populous cities, of fleets
and armies, of lands teeming with wealth and industry.
And to Spain should all these blessings and
advantages accrue; to Spain through him.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">SPEECH OF VASCO NUÑEZ.</div>

<p>
Dropping on his knees, he poured forth praise and
thanksgiving to the author of that glorious creation
for the honor of its discovery. The soldiers then
pressed forward, gazed enchanted likewise, and likewise
assumed the attitude of prayer; for however
ungodly were their lives, these cavaliers were always
fond of praying.
</p>

<p>
"There, my friends," exclaimed Balboa, rising and
pointing to the prospect before him, "there is the
realization of your hopes, the reward of your labors.
You are the first Christians to look upon that sea, or
to tread its luxuriant shores. The words of the chivalrous
Panciaco concerning the Southern Sea are
more than verified; please God so may we find them
regarding the riches of its shore. All are yours, I
say, yours the glory of laying this celestial realm at
your sovereign's feet; yours the privilege of bringing
to the only vile thing in it the cleansing properties of
our holy faith. Continue, then, true to me, and I
promise you honor and wealth to your fullest desire."
A shout of approbation, such as the rabble are ever
ready with before success, was followed by pledges of
fidelity and fair service, to be broken upon the first
occasion. And if we may believe old Peter Martyr,
who enjoyed this triumph of progress almost as much
as the discoverers themselves, Hannibal from the
summit of the Alps, pointing to his soldiers the delicious
fields of Italy, displayed no grander conception
of his high achievements, past and future, than did
Balboa at this moment. A cross was erected, round
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_368' href='#Page_368'>368</a></span>
which stones were heaped; the trees were blazoned
with the sovereign's name; the Te Deum laudamus
and Te Dominum confitemur was solemnly chanted
by the company; after which Balboa in a loud voice
called on all present to witness that he then and
thereby, for and in the name of the sovereigns of
Spain, took possession of this Southern Sea, with all
its islands and firm lands, and all shores washed by
its waters. The notary was ordered to draw up a
certificate in accordance, to which each present affixed
his name.<a id='FA_IX-8' href='#FN_IX-8' class='fnanchor'>[IX-8]</a>
</p>

<p>
Because the strangers seemed to delight in it, the
savages assisted in the cross-raising and in carrying
stones, though they saw nothing in the surroundings
to become so excited about. Meanwhile the Spaniards
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_369' href='#Page_369'>369</a></span>
wondered how far the water extended, what nations
inhabited its borders, what the commerce and religion
of those nations, and what would be the effect
of the discovery on Spain, on the world, on their own
fortunes.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHIAPES AND THE SPANIARDS.</div>

<p>
Descending the mountains on its seaward side
they were met by a cacique, called like his province,
Chiapes, who ordered them back if they sought not
death. The policy of Vasco Nuñez here was peace.
Hostile entanglements at this juncture he knew
would sooner or later result in the destruction of his
party. It must be a peace, however, based on fear
and respect, seldom to be achieved among savages
except by slaughter. Overtures of friendship were
accordingly instituted by a sudden and vigorous onslaught
with fire-arms, cross-bows, and bloodhounds,
during which Chiapes took to his heels, midst thunder,
smoke, and consternation; in consequence of which he
was all the more happy when the men of Quarequá
sought him out, and told him that these supernatural
visitors who held the elements at their command
were easily propitiated with gold. Tremblingly he
appeared and laid at the feet of Vasco Nuñez five
hundred pounds of the metal, glad that the favor of
the gods might be bought so cheaply. The Quarequá
guides were now dismissed with presents, and by them
orders were sent the Spaniards resting at their town
to follow the advance party.
</p>

<p>
The object of Vasco Nuñez was to approach the
verge of the ocean and touch the water he had
seen. For this purpose he despatched, in different
directions, three parties of twelve men each, under
Francisco Pizarro, Alonso Martin de Don Benito,
and Juan de Escaray to search an opening to the
seaside through the dense foliage that concealed it.
It is not a little singular that two days should
elapse, and that the explorers suffered severely
for want of water before any one could find the
beach, though they were all the time so near it.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_370' href='#Page_370'>370</a></span>
Alonso Martin's party came first to an inlet, on the
shore of which were two canoes, the open bay being
still hidden. Desirous of being first in something,
however small, Martin sprang into one of the boats
which was barely floating on the incoming tide, and
cried to his companions, who had thrown themselves
down under the cooling leaves—"I call on you all to
witness that I am the first Spaniard to sail upon these
waters." "And I the second," exclaimed another,
rushing for the other boat.<a id='FA_IX-9' href='#FN_IX-9' class='fnanchor'>[IX-9]</a> Returning to Chiapes,
Martin reported to Vasco Nuñez, who immediately
began preparations to take more formal possession of
the Southern Sea.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">TAKING POSSESSION.</div>

<p>
On the 29th of September, St Michael's day, Vasco
Nuñez with twenty-six men set out for the border
of the sea, accompanied by Chiapes with a numerous
train. Arriving there they found the tide out, and
seated themselves upon a grassy slope beneath the
overhanging foliage, waiting the return of the waters.
Presently, when the sand was covered to the depth of
one or two feet, all arose, and Vasco Nuñez, armed
and armored cap-a-pie, drew his sword and, taking from
the hand of an attendant a banner, on one side of
which were pictured the virgin and child and on the
other the arms of Castile and Leon, marched into the
water, and waving aloft his banner cried in a loud
voice: "Long live the high and powerful monarchs
Don Fernando and Doña Juana, sovereigns of Castile,
and of Leon, and of Aragon, in whose name, and
for the royal crown of Castile, I take and seize real
and corporeal actual possession of these seas and
lands, and coasts and ports and islands of the south,
with all thereto annexed; and kingdoms and provinces
which belong to them, or which may hereafter belong
to them, in whatever manner and by whatever right
and title acquired, now existing or which may exist,
ancient and modern, in times past and present and to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_371' href='#Page_371'>371</a></span>
come, without any contradiction. And if any other
prince or captain, christian or infidel, of whatever law
or sect or condition he may be, pretends any right to
these lands and seas, I am ready and prepared to contradict
him, and to defend them in the names of the present
and future sovereigns of Castile, who are the lords paramount
in these Indies, islands and firm land, northern
and southern, with their seas, as well in the arctic pole
as in the antarctic, on either side of the equinoctial
line, within or without the tropics of cancer and capricorn,
according to what more completely to their
majesties and their successors belongs and is due, for
the whole and any part thereof; as I protest in writing
shall or may be more fully specified and alleged on
behalf of their royal patrimony; now and in all time
while the earth revolves, and until the universal
judgment of all mankind."<a id='FA_IX-10' href='#FN_IX-10' class='fnanchor'>[IX-10]</a> To which grandiloquent
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_372' href='#Page_372'>372</a></span>
harangue there came no reply; no armed Poseidon
appeared to dispute possession; only the mighty ocean
dashed from its face the blinding glare of this new
doctrine, heaved its bosom in long glassy swells,
and gently growled its perplexity to the sympathizing
beach.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE NAME PACIFIC OCEAN.</div>

<p>
The followers of Vasco Nuñez, however, even if all
did not comprehend better than the sea what their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_373' href='#Page_373'>373</a></span>
leader had said, swore with loud acclamations to
defend the claim of the sovereign who would thereby
have so much more land to bestow, and to follow
their gallant leader to the riches and honor he had
so freely promised them. Andrés de Valderrábano,
the notary of the expedition, was then called upon
to draw up a certificate of the act of taking possession,
to which all present subscribed their names. This
being the day of St Michael,<a id='FA_IX-11' href='#FN_IX-11' class='fnanchor'>[IX-11]</a> the archangel, the
gulf before them was called El golfo de San Miguel,
which name it bears to this day. Tasting the water
they found it salt, which proved it a true ocean sea
that they had found; then they cut crosses on the
trees in honor of the holy trinity, and with longings
satisfied and hearts singing their high hopes, the
party returned to Chiapes, richer, according to their
pretensions, by one Pacific Ocean,<a id='FA_IX-12' href='#FN_IX-12' class='fnanchor'>[IX-12]</a> ten thousand
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_374' href='#Page_374'>374</a></span>
islands, and twenty-five hundred leagues of continental
seaboard.
</p>

<p>
The grand event being so happily consummated,
the Spaniards thought that, before returning to
Antigua, they might indulge in a little exploration.
Luckily the powerful Chiapes was not only their
friend, but he could furnish them a goodly list of
enemies having an abundance of gold and pearls.
Under his direction they crossed a large river, fell
upon a chieftain called Cocura, and returned to Chiapes
with six hundred and fifty pesos. Then they
decided to explore an arm of the gulf, which involved
a short but dangerous canoe voyage. In
vain Chiapes protested against the project. "Our
God will protect us," replied the devout Vasco
Nuñez, as with eighty Spaniards, and a dusky band
under Chiapes, he stepped into the canoes, the
17th of October. Soon they found themselves in a
sea so tempestuous that they were glad to escape
upon an island whose uncertain soil threatened every
moment to dissolve beneath their feet. There they
remained up to their waists in water all that night.
Fortunately before morning the waters of the gulf
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_375' href='#Page_375'>375</a></span>
subsided, else the discoverers of the Pacific Ocean
never would have returned to tell their tale. Daybreak
presented a dismal spectacle. Some of the
canoes were split, others embedded in the sand; and
all the provisions and clothing had been swept away.
But to such hardships these men were inured. Since
leaving Spain they had lived chiefly on maize bread,
wild herbs, fruit, roots, sometimes fish, seldom meat.
This was their best diet. In times of scarcity, which
were frequent, they were glad to get reptiles, insects,
or anything that would sustain life. They had no
salt; and their only drink was river water, frequently
putrid and unwholesome. Yet while life lasted, the
brain worked inexhaustible resources. In the present
emergency, for example, when both sea and land
proved treacherous, they by no means yielded to despair.
Stripping the glutinous bark from certain young
trees which they found, they bruised it with stones,
added to it fibrous sea-plants reduced in like manner,
and, after binding their broken boats firmly with
cords, they calked the seams with the mixture.
Again they committed themselves to the mercy of
the sea, and after two days of hazardous navigation,
half naked and half starved, they ran into a small
creek which flowed through a province called Chitarraga,
and landed about midnight near an Indian
village governed by a cacique named Tumaco.<a id='FA_IX-13' href='#FN_IX-13' class='fnanchor'>[IX-13]</a>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">PEARL GATHERING.</div>

<p>
Carrying the village, though not without resistance,
Vasco Nuñez, as usual, sought the friendship of the
fleeing Tumaco, who was induced to return, bringing
gold valued at six hundred and fourteen pesos, and a
basin of pearls, two hundred and forty of which were
of extraordinary size. This was indeed something
worthy of an oriental India, thought the Spaniards,
as their hearts danced enraptured over the beautiful
baubles. Tumaco could not understand what power
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_376' href='#Page_376'>376</a></span>
his gift possessed that it should so charm these
heavenly strangers. To him the oyster which he
could eat was seemingly worth more than the pearl
which he could not eat; for in roasting the bivalve
he had spoilt pearls enough to make him rich in the
eyes of any potentate in Christendom. When once
he knew that pearls were wealth, Tumaco became
eager to show the Spaniards how much he had at his
command, and set his men to fish; and in four days
they returned with twelve marks' weight, or ninety-six
ounces of pearls. Six Spaniards accompanied
them to see whence came the gems, and they showed
the natives how to open oysters without heat, which
discolored the pearl. Likewise gold hereabout was
plentiful and lightly esteemed.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Vasco Nuñez endeavored to gain all the information
possible concerning the nature and extent of the sea-coast.
He was told by Tumaco that the ocean and
the mainland extended southward without end; that
far distant in that direction dwelt a great nation whose
riches were immense, who navigated the ocean in
ships, and employed beasts of burden. In order the
better to describe these animals, Tumaco moulded in
clay a figure of the llama, which seemed to the eyes
of the Spaniards a species of camel. "And this," says
Herrera, "was the second intimation Vasco Nuñez
had of Peru, and of its wealth." Nor did Francisco
Pizarro, who was present, fail to hold these things in
remembrance.
</p>

<p>
Balboa now felt his mission accomplished. Had
the new sea and its border been made for him it
could not have pleased him better. Columbus had
found a new continent; he had found a new sea; and
wealth on this south side seemed illimitable. But before
returning he deemed it prudent to supplement his
deed of possession by the enactment of that ceremonial
on the shore of the main ocean, for his exploits had
hitherto been confined to the gulf of San Miguel.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_377' href='#Page_377'>377</a></span>
Applying to Tumaco for the requisite means, an
immense canoe was produced, the barge of state, with
oarsmen, and oars inlaid with <i>aljófar</i>, an inferior kind
of pearl; and Vasco Nuñez called on the notary to
write it down, that boats on this Southern Sea were
propelled by oars inlaid with pearl, so that his sovereigns
might thereby place a greater value on it and
on his own great services.
</p>

<p>
In pursuance of this plan, on the 29th of October,
the Spaniards embarked in Tumaco's barge, and, proceeding
to the shore of the main ocean, landed near an
island called by the natives Crucraga, but to which
Vasco Nuñez gave the name of San Simon. Here
with banner and buckler, with drawn sword and high-sounding
declamation, and amidst the lordly waves
which had rolled their unimpeded course from far beyond
the ever lifting horizon, the vaunting cavalier
again affirmed ownership, swearing to defend he
knew not what against he knew not whom; but
"herein," according to Herrera, "he used all the formalities
that could be imagined, for he was brave,
subtle, diligent, and of a generous temper, a commander
fit for mighty enterprises."
</p>

<p>
As they were about to depart, the men of Chitarraga
directed the attention of Balboa to a group of
small low islands rising from the sea five leagues
distant. A powerful chieftain governed there, who,
crossing to the mainland, made fearful havoc among
the seaboard villages; and would the Spaniards please
go and kill him, for at the largest island, Toe, were
the most beautiful pearls in all that region. The
Spaniards would go there or elsewhere for pearls and
gold if they only had the time, and a favorable sea,
but Vasco Nuñez would not permit himself to be
led away into further fascinations on this visit. He
nevertheless gave names to the islands, calling the
largest Isla Rica, and the group Islas de las Perlas,<a id='FA_IX-14' href='#FN_IX-14' class='fnanchor'>[IX-14]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_378' href='#Page_378'>378</a></span>
or Pearl Islands, assuring Tumaco, meanwhile, that
he would return some day and avenge him his injuries.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE RETURN.</div>

<p>
Once more back at Chitarraga, Vasco Nuñez made
ready his departure for Antigua. He proposed to
cross the mountains by a different route from that by
which he came. The sick and disabled he would leave
with Chiapes, now the firm friend of the Spaniards,
who were to kill his enemies and not him. This
chieftain and a son of Tumaco asked permission to accompany
the party as far as Teaochoan, an adjoining
province. Accordingly, on the 3d of November, they
embarked in canoes, and guided by the young cacique
of Chitarraga, proceeded to the upper end of the gulf
and entered a large river,<a id='FA_IX-15' href='#FN_IX-15' class='fnanchor'>[IX-15]</a> so inconstant as to overflow
its banks in places, narrowing elsewhere between
rocky confines, and rushing forward tumultuously
under the overhanging foliage to the sea. By and
by the youthful chieftain brought the boats to land.
Disembarking, the Spaniards pacified the province in
their usual way, the ruler, Teoca, chief of Teaochoan,
being glad to save his life by paying one hundred and
sixty ounces of gold and two hundred large pearls.
Indeed, so effectually had Vasco Nuñez succeeded, by
a judicious use of fire-arms and fair words, and some
trifling presents, in winning the affections of the South
Sea savages, that in taking leave of Chiapes and
the Chitarraga youth at Teoca's town, they wept.
It was indeed affecting; and soon Teoca, although the
last to be robbed, caught himself paying the strangers
the same briny tribute of his esteem.
</p>

<p>
After three days of rest the party proceeded, and
reaching the base of the mountains they began to scale
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_379' href='#Page_379'>379</a></span>
them. A supply of dried fish and maize, with men
of burden and guides, had been secured, and they were
accompanied by Teoca's son, who had instructions to
attend to all requirements of the strangers, and not
to leave them without the permission of their commander.
It was well for the company that they had a
leader thoughtful and efficient; that instead of zealous
guides, and willing men to bear the burdens, there
were not lurking foes or treacherous friends with
whom to deal—not one of them otherwise would have
reached Antigua. For, toiling up the steep ascent
under a burning sun, they soon found themselves without
water, the springs upon which they had depended
having failed. One by one the men yielded their
strength and threw themselves upon the ground, victims
of despair. Teoca's son assisted and encouraged
them, and finally brought them all in safety to a cool,
sequestered valley where were life-restoring waters.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">INFAMOUS ACT OF BALBOA.</div>

<p>
Was it their way of giving thanks for the late
escape from death, now to plan the death of others?
While resting in the refreshing shade, Balboa asked
his guide about a certain Poncra, a hideous despot,
as rich as he was repulsive, of whom he had heard
much. "We are now within his lands," the young
chief replied. "Over the brow of yonder hill is situated
his village." Then was detailed a story of this
man's wickedness which sent a thrill of pleasing horror
to the heart of every Spaniard present. Instantly all
was excitement; and those so lately the readiest to
faint were now the readiest to fight. Marching forward
they entered the village only to find the vulture
flown. Finely wrought gold to the value of three
thousand pesos was found there to reconcile them to
his absence. Scouts soon discovered his retreat, however,
and partly by threats and partly by promises
of safety, this lump of deformity was induced to give
himself up with three of his principal men. No sooner
was it known that the hated Poncra was prisoner in
the hands of the Spaniards, than the neighboring
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_380' href='#Page_380'>380</a></span>
chieftains flocked in and begged his extermination.
"Whence came your gold?" demanded Balboa of the
unhappy man. "I know not," replied Poncra. "My
forefathers left it me. We place no value on the
unwrought metal." Although torture was applied,
nothing further could be elicited. The bystanders
clamored loudly for his death, charging him with
infamous crimes, revolting to humanity. In an evil
moment Vasco Nuñez yielded. The bloodhounds
were let loose, and loud acclamations rent the air
as the quivering flesh was torn from the limbs
of the four unfortunate wretches, and they were
made, as Ogilby says, "a Breakfast to the Spanish
Doggs." Vasco Nuñez de Balboa gained the approval
of the crowd; but throughout all time, wherever
the name of the illustrious discoverer of the
Southern Sea is spoken, this infamous act of treachery
shall stain it. The praises of the savages, however,
were profuse; "and there he remained thirty days,"
says Gomara, "receiving and ruling like a king." And
very prettily Balboa commemorates his outrage by
calling the place Todos Los Santos.
</p>

<p>
While resting here, the Spaniards were joined by
the comrades who had been left at Chiapes. Throughout
all this region the strangers were treated as invincible
and superhuman. Passing through the domain
of a chief named Bononiama, they were not only received
as friends, coming as they did from Chiapes,
but were presented with gold to the value of two
thousand pesos, and the chief accompanied them to
Poncra's village, that he might behold the wonderful
leader of these wonderful men. Poncra's successor
came forward in answer to overtures of peace; and
on the first of December the Spaniards continued
their journey, weighted down with spoils. Five days
brought them to a small depopulated town whose
chief, Buquebuca, had fled because he had not the
means, he said, fitly to entertain such illustrious visitors.
He was permitted to purchase their favor by
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_381' href='#Page_381'>381</a></span>
delivering up the gold in his possession, including
some finely wrought plates.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">BALBOA AMONG THE CACIQUES.</div>

<p>
Following a path northward from Buquebuca's they
were hailed from a cliff near by. "Our King Chioriso
sends greeting, O mighty men! and presents this offering,
begging your assistance in vanquishing an enemy
too powerful for him." The gift was certainly persuasive,
being no less than thirty large gold medals
or plates worth fourteen thousand pesos. Balboa
scarcely knew what to do, nevertheless he graciously
received it, and sent in return three axes, some gilt
beads, and several pieces of leather and cloth, making
the recipient to his own thinking the richest potentate
in savagedom. Balboa furthermore promised to assist
him at some future time in his wars. The country
through which they were now passing was exceptionally
rugged, and the men of burden were quite
exhausted when on the 13th of December they arrived
at the village of Pocorosa. Several of the soldiers had
also fallen seriously ill from fatigue, and it was accordingly
decided to tarry here for thirty days. The
chief, as usual, had fled at their approach, but was
brought back to purchase friendship of the Spaniards
with slaves and gold.
</p>

<p>
Pocorosa informed the Spaniards that not far from
there<a id='FA_IX-16' href='#FN_IX-16' class='fnanchor'>[IX-16]</a> lived the famous Tubanamá, of whom Panciaco
had spoken when first directing the attention of
the Spaniards to the South Sea. He was reputed the
richest as well as the strongest chieftain of these
mountains, and was the terror of the neighboring
nations. Balboa felt it more than ever his duty to
overthrow Tubanamá, kill some of his men, steal a
few of his women, and relieve him of his gold. But
to do this he must have a thousand soldiers, so he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_382' href='#Page_382'>382</a></span>
had been told. Casting his eye over his little band
of bruised and wayworn men, he thought how one
mistake might swallow all his past successes, and
sighed; then he slept on it, and when after a few
days' rest the question was adventured, enough were
eager for the raid. The result was that seventy Spaniards,
and a squad of Pocorosa's warriors, after a rapid
march, fell on Tubanamá about midnight and brought
him away prisoner, Ogilby says with eighty concubines.
The men of Pocorosa, and chiefs of adjoining
tribes, began to revile him, and begged of Vasco
Nuñez his immediate death. He had done worse
things than Poncra, they said, and had beside spoken
ill of the Spaniards, threatening to drag them to
death by the hair of their head if ever they came
within his reach. Vasco Nuñez pondered. For some
time past he had entertained a plan of establishing in
this vicinity a military post for the protection of commerce
between the seas, and also of gold-mining.
Was it better to kill this chief as an enemy, or let
him live as a friend, and assist to keep the others
friendly? He chose the latter course. But first he
must temper the proposed friendship by trial. "Infamous
tyrant," he thundered at the trembling prisoner,
"now shalt thou suffer for thine abominations. Thou
shalt be made to feel the power of the Christians,
and the same doom which thou before thy naked
slaves didst promise them, shall now be meted thee."
He then motioned the attendants as if to remove him
for execution. The unhappy cacique denied the accusations
and begged for his life. Balboa apparently
overcome by his entreaties slowly relented, and finally
ordered the captive released. The overjoyed chieftain
could not do enough for his deliverer. He
stripped his women of their ornaments, and, collecting
all articles within his reach fabricated of the coveted
metal, presented the Spaniards with thirty marks of
gold, and his subjects soon brought in sixty marks
more. Enjoining Tubanamá to gather gold, and ever
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_383' href='#Page_383'>383</a></span>
remain true to the Spaniards, Balboa returned in triumph
to Pocorosa's town, with a long train of enslaved
captives. About this time Vasco Nuñez fell sick; and no
wonder when we consider the strain on mind and body
during the past four months. First in every action,
bearing exposure and privation in common with the
poorest soldier, with the responsibility of the adventure
resting wholly on him, he was a fit subject for
fever. But his indomitable spirit never forsook him,
and causing himself to be carried on a litter he still
directed movements, as they resumed their march.
</p>

<p>
Weary, ragged, but exultant, the party at length
reached the village of Comagre. Panciaco was overjoyed
to see them. The old chief was dead, and
the young man filled his father's place. He could
not do enough for Vasco Nuñez, for whom his
affection seemed to grow in proportion as he was permitted
to do him service. Panciaco had given the
strangers gold and slaves; he had entertained them
royally, had told them of the Southern Sea and the
way to reach it, all his words proving true. Now he
was permitted to entertain and nurse the emaciated
Spaniards, and this he did with lavish generosity,
watching Vasco Nuñez through his sickness with the
affection of a brother. He was permitted to give them
more gold, and did so. The Spaniards graciously
received these benefits; and in return for obligations
too vast for requital, the generous cavalier, the chivalrous
discoverer of the great South Sea, gave his
friend and benefactor a linen shirt and some worthless
trinkets. His parting words were "Gather and
send me more gold, Panciaco." The chief, however,
before the party left, had embraced Christianity and
received baptism.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">ARRIVAL AT ANTIGUA.</div>

<p>
It was the 14th of January that the party left
Comagre. A short and easy march brought them to
Poncra's village, where fortune wreathed in smiles
still attended the commander, now free from illness
and loaded with gold. Vasco Nuñez here was met
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_384' href='#Page_384'>384</a></span>
by four Spaniards from Antigua who had come to
report the arrival of two vessels from Española with
provisions and reinforcements. Leaving the greater
part of his company to follow at their leisure, Balboa
with twenty men pressed forward, and after a hearty
greeting from Careta at his village, embarked in the
brigantine which there awaited him, and arrived the
19th of January, 1514.
</p>

<p>
His entry into the settlement was a triumph. All
the people came to welcome him, and he was conducted
to the public square midst loud acclaims. And
when he told them of his successes, of the wealth-bound
sea, and the treasures he had obtained, they
were wild with exultation. Beside gold, to the value
of more than forty thousand pesos,<a id='FA_IX-17' href='#FN_IX-17' class='fnanchor'>[IX-17]</a> the Spaniards
had brought eight hundred Indian slaves, and a large
quantity of pearls, cotton cloth, and Indian weapons.
All the nations on the route, both in going and in
coming, had been subjugated without the loss of a
battle and without the loss of a man. Thus terminated
one of the grandest and most successful achievements
of the Spaniards in the New World.
</p>

<p class="p2">
The remainder of the company soon arrived, and
the spoils were thereupon distributed in equitable
allotments, wherein also those participated who had
remained at home. Beside the royal share, two hundred
of the largest and most beautiful pearls were
set apart by Vasco Nuñez and his companions as a
present for the king, and one of their number, Pedro
de Arbolancha, an intelligent man and trusty friend
of the governor, was chosen as envoy to proceed immediately
to Spain and proclaim this important discovery.
By him Vasco Nuñez sent the sovereign a
letter detailing his brilliant achievement, and requesting
the royal appointment as governor of the region by
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_385' href='#Page_385'>385</a></span>
him discovered, with the means to prosecute further
adventures on that coast. "And in all his long letter,"
says Peter Martyr, "there is not a single leaf
written which does not contain thanks to Almighty
God for delivery from perils, and preservation from
many imminent dangers." This letter was dated at
Antigua the 4th of March, and a few days after
Arbolancha took his departure.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">PROSPERITY OF THE COLONY.</div>

<p>
Meanwhile Balboa was unremitting in his efforts
to advance the prosperity of the growing colony.
Having so long suffered the miseries and inconvenience
of a meagre supply of food, particular attention
was turned to agriculture. Indian corn was
produced in great quantities, and seeds of various
kinds from Spain were planted, yielding fruit in
abundance. Society became more settled and factions
were at rest; for who could stand before Vasco
Nuñez? Memories of home bloomed anew. Old-time
amusements were again enjoyed; national holidays
were regarded, and jousts and tournaments were
held, if not with as rich display as formerly, yet with
heartiness and merrymaking. Two of the pacified
caciques became discontented and rebelled, but were
soon quieted by a few men under Diego Hurtado.
Another captain, Andrés Garabito, was sent to explore
the country for the shortest and best route
between the seas. Peace everywhere reigned; and
with a profusion of food and gold already in store,
with high anticipations regarding the future; with
wealth, and dominion, and honor, and brilliant hopes,
and multitudes of heathen for slaves, ought not these
pirates to have been supremely happy?

<p>
In Spain the tidings of Balboa's discovery created
little less sensation than had that of Columbus twenty-two
years before. The hypothesis still obtaining that
America was eastern Asia, to what new manifestations
was not this Southern Sea to lead? Coupled with
the belief was the concurrent testimony of all the
native peoples, that along its shores were wealth and
industry, gold, pearls, and civilization, hope-inspiring
of replenished coffers to Ferdinand, and to zealous
churchmen of increase of souls. At last, said the wise
men, the opulent kingdoms of the eastern Indies which
have so long eluded our grasp are opened to us.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately for Vasco Nuñez, success came late;
for prior to the arrival of his messenger in Spain there
had been laid a train of events which threatened his
ruin. Fanned to a yet redder reality by the argumentative
winds of the Atlantic, Enciso's wrath glowed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_387' href='#Page_387'>387</a></span>
hot as he pictured to the king in only too truthful
colors the quality of justice administered in his name
to his subjects of Antigua. And the bachiller became
really happy as he rolled the story of Nicuesa's wrongs,
a sweet morsel, under his tongue, to the utter demolition
of his enemies. Zamudio and Vasco Nuñez were
condemned, as we have seen, and the king determined
to send out a new governor who should investigate
and punish.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">A NEW GOVERNOR.</div>

<p>
Out of the many applying was chosen a gentleman
of Arias in Segovia, Pedro Arias de Ávila, called by
Spanish contemporaries Pedrarias, and by English historians
Dávila. He was large of frame, pronounced
in mind and temper, and coarse-grained throughout,
the grizzled hair surrounding his dark features like
the selfish and unholy nature that environed his
swarthy soul. Whence it would appear that he was
elderly for so rude a mission, which was true; but
being an officer in good repute, well born and highly
connected,<a id='FA_X-1' href='#FN_X-1' class='fnanchor'>[X-1]</a> and with no lack of fire and stubbornness
remaining, his age was not reckoned so much against
him. The nicknames El Galan and El Justador were
significant of a gay and courtly youth, as that of Furor
Domini, given him by the monks of the New World,
was of a virulent old age. He was rich, at least his
friends were, so that money was at his command.
Fonseca favored the appointment—a habit the bishop
had of looking kindly on those whose petitions were
backed by gold. And so Ferdinand made him governor
and captain-general of Castilla del Oro, which
was now ordered to be called Castilla Aurífica.<a id='FA_X-2' href='#FN_X-2' class='fnanchor'>[X-2]</a>
</p>

<p>
Several causes united to favor Pedrarias at this
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_388' href='#Page_388'>388</a></span>
juncture. The arrival at court of Caicedo and Colmenares,
commissioned by the settlers of Antigua to
report the rumors concerning a sea to the south, and
solicit aid for an expedition in that direction, renewed
speculation and inspired enthusiasm.<a id='FA_X-3' href='#FN_X-3' class='fnanchor'>[X-3]</a> The envoys
were graciously received, and presented by Bishop
Fonseca to the king, who listened with attention to
their recitals. "They often sojourned with me," says
old Peter Martyr, "and their countenances declare
the intemperateness of the air of Darien; for they are
yellow like those afflicted with the jaundice," or as
Oviedo expresses it, "as yellow as the gold they went
to seek," "and also swollen," continues the former,
"the cause whereof they ascribe to the hunger endured
in times past." The air of mystery enfolding the
region, no less than the gold displayed by persons
coming thence, threw over the enterprise a charm
which brought to the standard of Pedrarias hundreds
of eager applicants. Then there was the sudden
breaking-up of the Italian expedition under Gonsalo
de Córdoba. The French victory at Ravenna, which
threatened King Ferdinand's Neapolitan possessions,
had roused the chivalry of Spain, and when the
standard of the Gran Capitan was raised at Seville,
thither flocked youthful cavaliers and veteran soldiers
burning to enlist under the banner of so great a
leader in so glorious a cause. But the king, envious
of the popularity of his general, in a fit of jealousy
countermanded the expedition, thus filling the streets
of Seville with purposeless men, many of whom had
sold or pawned their birthright for means to procure
an outfit, and who now preferred any adventure,
however desperate, rather than return in humiliation
to their homes. Therefore they hailed with rapture
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_389' href='#Page_389'>389</a></span>
this New World enterprise where gold as well as
glory might be won. Moreover, the success of Portugal
in India, with which Spain's in the west compared
unfavorably, and which had engendered both fear and
envy, oiled the wheels of government and unlocked
the royal strong-box, so that the ducats of Pedrarias
were increased in number to fifty thousand, "an enormous
sum in those days," as Quintana observes, "in
the expenditure of which was manifest the interest
and importance attached to the enterprise."<a id='FA_X-4' href='#FN_X-4' class='fnanchor'>[X-4]</a> Arms
and ammunition were drawn from the royal arsenal;
and in place of the heavy iron armor which had
proved oppressive in tropical latitudes, were substituted
wooden bucklers and coats of quilted cotton,
proof sufficient against the weapons of the natives.
The fleet numbered about nineteen sail, with accommodations
for twelve hundred men. These were soon
enrolled, while as many more offering themselves had
of necessity to be refused. Subsequently, by permission
of the Council of the Indies, the number was
increased to fifteen hundred.<a id='FA_X-5' href='#FN_X-5' class='fnanchor'>[X-5]</a>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">RETINUE OF PEDRARIAS.</div>

<p>
Pedrarias was accompanied by his wife, Isabel
de Bobadilla, an estimable lady, niece to the Marchioness
de Moya.<a id='FA_X-6' href='#FN_X-6' class='fnanchor'>[X-6]</a> The other members of his family,
consisting of four sons and four daughters, were left
in Spain. Among the officers were several nobles;
and his followers consisted, as was usual in these mad
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_390' href='#Page_390'>390</a></span>
migrations, of persons of every caste, not alone the
young and naturally thoughtless, but, if we may credit
Peter Martyr, "no small number of covetous old men"
were of the company. They were mostly officials,
cavaliers and ecclesiastics, however, for governing,
fighting, and preaching offered the chief attractions;
and very few artisans, agriculturists, or colonists of
value in constructing a permanent and prosperous
commonwealth. Under the new government a young
man from the schools of Salamanca, called the Licenciado
Gaspar de Espinosa, was appointed alcalde
mayor; Bachiller Enciso, alguacil mayor; Alonso de
la Puente, treasurer; Gonzalo Fernandez de Oviedo
y Valdés, the historian, veedor or inspector;<a id='FA_X-7' href='#FN_X-7' class='fnanchor'>[X-7]</a> Diego
Marquez, contador, and Juan de Tabira, factor. The
fighting men were, first, the governor's lieutenant,
Juan de Ayora, an hidalgo of Córdova, and brother
of the chronicler, Gonzalo de Ayora. Next, captains
of hundreds, Luis Carrillo, Francisco Dávila, Antonio
Tello de Guzman, Diego de Bustamante, Gonzalo de
Badajoz, Diego Albites, Contreras, Gamarra, Villafañe,
Atienza, Meneses, Gonzalo Fernandez de Llago,
Francisco Compañon, Francisco Vazquez Coronado
de Valdés, Juan de Zorita, Francisco Hernandez,
Gaspar de Morales, cousin of the governor, and a
nephew of the governor, likewise named Pedrarias,
captain of artillery, and others. Several of these
names became notable, and we shall meet them hereafter.
Chief of the spiritual army, under the title of
Bishop of Darien,<a id='FA_X-8' href='#FN_X-8' class='fnanchor'>[X-8]</a> was Juan de Quevedo, the first
prelate to come to Tierra Firme; and with him was
a company of Franciscan friars. Bernal Diaz del
Castillo, then but little more than a youth, afterward
the chronicler of the Mexican conquest, came with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_391' href='#Page_391'>391</a></span>
the expedition, and also Pascual de Andagoya, Hernando
de Soto, discoverer of the Mississippi, Benalcázar,
who afterward conquered Quito, and Diego de
Almagro, one of the pacificators of Peru. It was, in
truth, a brilliant company. Juan Serrano was chief
pilot, he who was subsequently killed with Magellan,
the discoverer of the strait that now bears that name.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">REGULATIONS FOR THE COLONY.</div>

<p>
Cemaco's village, still bearing the name of Santa
María de la Antigua del Darien, was by royal ordinance
raised to the title and dignity of a city, with
metropolitan prerogatives, ecclesiastical as well as
civil. Lengthy instructions were provided the governor
by the Council of the Indies. He was charged
to see that his people were properly clad, comfortably
but not extravagantly; to prohibit the sale or use of
cards and dice; to punish murder, theft, and blasphemy;
to tolerate no lawyer or any ecclesiastical or professional
or unprofessional practitioner of the law in the
colony;<a id='FA_X-9' href='#FN_X-9' class='fnanchor'>[X-9]</a> to take no important step without consulting
the bishop and other royal officials—an injudicious
measure which broke society into factions; to render
justice quickly and in accordance with the laws of
Spain; to be a bright and shining light to the heathen
in all truth and fair honesty; and, last of all, by no
means to forget the king's share of the spoils taken in
the exercise of said virtues.<a id='FA_X-10' href='#FN_X-10' class='fnanchor'>[X-10]</a> The new governor was
furthermore charged to strip from Vasco Nuñez de
Balboa all semblance of authority, and to bring him
to a strict account for his misdeeds. The survivors
of poor Nicuesa's followers were to be treated with
special leniency, even to the remitting of the king's
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_392' href='#Page_392'>392</a></span>
fifth on their accumulations. All this, it will be remembered,
was before the discovery of the South Sea
became known in Spain; and that discovery remained
still unrevealed when, on the 11th of April, 1514,
after an ostentatious review in the plaza of Seville,
the fleet sailed away in grand glee from San Lúcar.<a id='FA_X-11' href='#FN_X-11' class='fnanchor'>[X-11]</a>
After touching at some of the islands for the purpose
of capturing Caribs for slaves, and also at Santa Marta
in order to ascertain the fate of eleven Spaniards said
to have been left there by Rodrigo de Colmenares,
the armament reached Darien in safety. Significant
of the coming rule was an incident which occurred
during one of the landings. A servant of Pedrarias,
named San Martin, had failed in respect toward Ayora,
the governor's lieutenant, while ashore. Informed of
it, Pedrarias ordered Ayora to return immediately and
hang the offender to the first tree, which was done.<a id='FA_X-12' href='#FN_X-12' class='fnanchor'>[X-12]</a>
</p>

<p class="p2">
Scarcely had the vessels of Pedrarias disappeared
from the shore of Spain, when the tardy envoy of
Vasco Nuñez arrived at court, and craved audience
of the king. Pedro de Arbolancha had unfortunately
delayed his departure from Darien for two months
after the return of the South Sea discoverers. On
this point of time turned the destinies of Vasco
Nuñez and of the New World. Pedrarias would
scarcely have been made governor; Pizarro would
probably never have become the conqueror of Peru,
and Vasco Nuñez might possibly have reached Mexico
before Cortés.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_393' href='#Page_393'>393</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Arbolancha was conducted into the royal presence.
He displayed his treasures and told his tale. The
sovereign's heart was touched at the soldier's recital.
Those pearls! They would make the darkest deeds
resplendent in righteousness. And that new Southern
Sea! Surely it would wash away far deeper stains
than any which sullied the hands of its gallant discoverer.
Oh! that this man had sooner come; for
then the many thousand ducats spent on old Pedrarias
might not have been out of their box. What this
costly armament was sent out to do, a handful of
roving Spaniards had done, under the leadership of
a condemned man, against whom the royal wrath up
to this moment had burned. And in this achieving
there had been neither much bloodshed nor any cost
to Spain; the current formulas for securing possession
had been observed, and even the king's fifth and the
king's present were not forgotten. In such performance
there was manifest no mean mind; any further
thought for the punishment of so meritorious a cavalier
could not be entertained; and King Ferdinand
resolved that Vasco Nuñez should not go unrewarded.
So rides success triumphant, even sagacious royalty
bending its stiff neck before it.<a id='FA_X-13' href='#FN_X-13' class='fnanchor'>[X-13]</a>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">ARRIVAL OF PEDRARIAS.</div>

<p class="p2">
Meanwhile Pedrarias entered Urabá Gulf and anchored
his fleet before Antigua. Not knowing in
what temper the redoubtable chieftain of the town
might receive a successor, Pedrarias despatched an
officer to acquaint the colonists with his presence, and
with the nature of his commission. Landing, the messenger
asked of the first men he met for their leader.
He was pointed where some native workmen were
thatching a small cottage under the direction of a
man clad in cotton jacket and drawers and pack-thread
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_394' href='#Page_394'>394</a></span>
shoes. Now silk and brocade was the covering
this petty officer had provided himself withal to
flaunt it in Italy, while this cotton-clad fellow looked
more like a common laborer than the governor of a
Spanish colony. Nevertheless the officer knew his
duty and approached the man in cotton respectfully.
"I come from Don Pedrarias de Ávila," said he,
"lately appointed governor of Darien."
</p>

<p>
It was sudden; like death, which, even when
expected, seems abrupt. How swiftly in his brain
revolved probabilities and possibilities. With self-possession
and courteous dignity, however, he answered
presently: "Say to Don Pedrarias that he is
welcome to Antigua."
</p>

<p>
Next day, which was the 30th of June, Pedrarias
disembarked. The landing, where he formed his brilliant
retinue, preparatory to the entry into the metropolis,
was a league from the town. On one side the
governor held by the hand his wife, Doña Isabel,
and on the other, arrayed in episcopal robes, walked
the bishop of Darien, while dignitaries, officers, cavaliers,
and adventurers followed in the line of march.
Near Antigua they were met by the sallow-faced
colonists, who, though ragged, were rich both in experience
and in gold.
</p>

<p>
The two leaders met with great courtesy; Vasco
Nuñez was reverent, Pedrarias gracious. Then all
went forward to the town, the friars chanting their
Te Deum laudamus for delivery from ocean perils.
Vasco Nuñez conducted Pedrarias and the officers to
his own dwelling, while the remainder of the company
were distributed among the colonists. And soon
a New World repast was spread before the new-comers,
consisting wholly of native products, maize
bread, esculent roots, fish, and fruit, and to drink
water.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">HYPOCRISY AND HATRED.</div>

<p class="p2">
And now begins a game played by malevolent craft
on one side, and honorable frankness on the other,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_395' href='#Page_395'>395</a></span>
which is unapproached by any of the New World
trickeries and treacheries. For whatever his faults,
whatever the pitfalls his tumultuous destiny had
spread for him, Vasco Nuñez was by nature single-hearted
and chivalrous, whereas Pedrarias Dávila was
almost satanic in jealousy and cold hatred.
</p>

<p>
Seeking an early interview, the latter assumes an
air of friendship, praises Vasco Nuñez for his abilities,
congratulates him on his successes, and speaks of the
high appreciation of the king. And as the object of
both is only the welfare of the colony, will he not
kindly write down what he has done and what he is
just now intending to do? Thrown from his guard by
this semblance of sincerity, Vasco Nuñez consents,
and writes not only what will enable Pedrarias to
profit by his experience, but, as the governor hopes,
to occasion his overthrow. For the old man is not
slow to perceive, on arriving at Antigua and learning
of the wonderful discovery, that he is now and must
be in reality second in these parts where so lately he
was appointed first. Dropping the mask, he institutes
charges, and orders Vasco Nuñez to stand trial
for his life.
</p>

<p>
As alcalde mayor, the investigation must be brought
before the licentiate Espinosa, and he, in conformity
with royal instructions, had to be associated with
the bishop Quevedo. Though inexperienced, Espinosa
is honest. As for the prelate—does not the
accused pray devoutly, and pay liberally? and does
he not send the good bishop gifts of slaves, and share
with him several lucrative enterprises? Go to! He
of the cask is not so great a simpleton after all.
He forces even Doña Isabel to smile upon him.
He is acquitted. The enraged Pedrarias then hurls
civil processes at him, until he is nearly ruined.
Enciso meanwhile manufactures fresh guilt relative
to the affair of Nicuesa. It is of no use; for the
bishop fattens. Pedrarias now swears he will send
the fellow to Spain for trial. This does not suit
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_396' href='#Page_396'>396</a></span>
Quevedo. "What madness," drawls the bishop, "to
send a successful man to court. Know you not that
ere this all Europe is ringing his praises? Better
keep him within your grasp; become reconciled, then
crush him under your protecting wing." Never is
more diabolical mercy solicited for a friend. The
governor perceives more than the prelate intends, and
immediately arrays his villainy in friendship's smiling
garb.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Amid such profitless pastime, too often the chief
occupation of rulers, the so lately hilarious fifteen
hundred were becoming hungry. The provisions they
had brought were exhausted. Looking at the five
hundred old settlers, the remnant of other fifteen
hundred, the unseasoned opened speculation as to
their own similar contraction. And straightway they
began to die; twenty a day, until seven hundred were
buried in their brocades. Sending under a strong
guard some provisions to a secret spot, at a distance
from the town, Pedrarias repaired thither and fed
himself.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Immediate occupation alone could save the survivors.
Taking advantage of Balboa's plans, Pedrarias
determined to appropriate to himself the benefits
of his discovery. Luckily, on hearing of the late
discovery, the king had written to establish a line of
posts from sea to sea,<a id='FA_X-14' href='#FN_X-14' class='fnanchor'>[X-14]</a> to make settlements, selecting
therefor healthy sites, where was good water; also to
build a town on the shore of San Miguel Gulf, and
three or four caravels likewise, giving them in charge
of skilful captains for the prosecution of new discoveries
in that direction. Accordingly, at once to plant
the line of posts and circumvent any efforts of Vasco
Nuñez in that direction, Juan de Ayora with four hundred
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_397' href='#Page_397'>397</a></span>
men was despatched across the mountains from
Careta.
</p>

<p>
We have found Balboa's policy in his treatment of
the natives severe enough, but that which was now
to be inaugurated makes his conduct seem humane in
comparison. Whatever harsh measures circumstances
at times seemed to him to render necessary, the fact
remains that on his return from the South Sea expedition
he left the nations friendly.<a id='FA_X-15' href='#FN_X-15' class='fnanchor'>[X-15]</a> In all their
bloody pacifyings, probably not one of the New World
commanders so nearly observed the wishes of their
Catholic majesties as Vasco Nuñez.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">REQUIREMENT OF THE INDIANS.</div>

<p>
Among the rules respecting the natives was one
directing how war should be made, and what the
savages must do in order to save themselves and
their lands. The formula drawn at an earlier date by
a conclave of Spanish jurists and divines, by which
Nicuesa, Ojeda, and others were to take possession of
territories, was superseded by a Requirement of the
Indians furnished Pedrarias by his sovereign, a translation
of which I give in full below.<a id='FA_X-16' href='#FN_X-16' class='fnanchor'>[X-16]</a> This requirement,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_398' href='#Page_398'>398</a></span>
which heralded to the heathen the name of
Christ and European civilization in terms ridiculous
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_399' href='#Page_399'>399</a></span>
and distasteful enough, was mild and logical in its intention
as compared with the horrors attending its
execution. In the instructions accompanying the
<i>requerimiento</i>, Pedrarias had been charged never to
wage war unless the Indians were the aggressors, nor
until they had been summoned to obedience once,
twice, three times. This the governor told his lieutenant,
but Pedrarias likewise told Ayora to send him
food and gold without delay. It was seldom difficult
to excite savages to acts of aggression, and as for
reading to the natives the requerimiento, as required
by law, that might be done by the notary at his convenience,
but never so as to interfere with the advantages
of a sudden surprise or preliminary butchery.
In a word, the requirement was no less void in practice
than absurd in theory.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">AYORA'S OUTRAGES.</div>

<p>
The first action of Ayora was evidence of this.
Ever since the union of Vasco Nuñez and Careta's
daughter, equivalent with the natives to a marriage,
the most friendly relations had existed between the
Spaniards and Careta's people. Not only did the
cacique present his respects in person to Pedrarias,
but many times he sent food to the famishing colonists.
It seems incredible that creatures in human form, to
say nothing of European or Christian men, should
repay such kindness by sudden, unprovoked attack,
such as surprising peaceful villages by night, firing the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_400' href='#Page_400'>400</a></span>
houses, and murdering some of the slumberers while
taking captive others, all being attended by wanton
cruelty and pillage. Yet such was the fate of Careta,
Panciaco, and other friends and allies of Vasco Nuñez.
From the accident of conquest, captives for slaves had
become one of the objects of conquest.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption hidepub"> <a href="images/i-474lg.png">View larger image</a>
</p>
</div>

<p>
After this brilliant achievement at Careta, Ayora
passed on to a small port which he named Santa
Cruz,<a id='FA_X-17' href='#FN_X-17' class='fnanchor'>[X-17]</a> where he planted the initial settlement of the
line which was to extend from sea to sea. Leaving
there eighty men, he marched southward, robbing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_401' href='#Page_401'>401</a></span>
and murdering as he went. "The caciques were tortured
to make them disclose their gold," writes Oviedo.
"Some they roasted, others they threw to the dogs,
others were hanged."<a id='FA_X-18' href='#FN_X-18' class='fnanchor'>[X-18]</a>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">HURTADO SENT OUT.</div>

<p class="p2">
If not for the church, then for himself the good
bishop of Darien was interested in the spoils of God's
enemies everywhere. In Ayora's maraudings he had
special interest; and no intelligence reaching Antigua
for some time concerning them, Quevedo suggested
to Pedrarias that a messenger be sent to ascertain
his lieutenant's progress. Bartolomé Hurtado, once
the friend of Vasco Nuñez, but anxious now before
the new powers to wipe out that stain, was accordingly
sent to bring in the plunder.
</p>

<p>
On the way, to please Pedrarias, Hurtado sought
to excel Ayora in rapine; but that was impossible. In
returning with the plunder, however, he stopped at
Careta's village and asked for men to carry burdens to
Antigua, and this was readily granted by the chief,
anxious as he still was for the friendship of the Spaniards.
After honorably discharging his trust with
regard to Ayora and Pedrarias, in manner becoming
a Christian and a cavalier, he selected from Careta's
men six of the finest specimens and presented them
as slaves to the governor; to the worthy bishop he
gave other six; and to Espinosa four. After thus
going the rounds among the high officials, the remainder
were branded and sold into slavery at public
sale.<a id='FA_X-19' href='#FN_X-19' class='fnanchor'>[X-19]</a> Hurtado was forgiven his former humanity.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_402' href='#Page_402'>402</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Entering the dominions of Tubanamá, Juan de
Ayora planted there another fortress which he left
in charge of Meneses. But instead of continuing his
labors across the Isthmus, as ordered, he determined
to give himself wholly up to robbery, and escape the
country before his offences should be fully known.
Following this plan he soon found himself overloaded
with booty; and, leaving his captains to overrun the
land at pleasure, he returned with his captives, gold,
and provisions to Antigua. The gold, he said, must
remain untouched, for future division. The provisions
were deposited with the governor, and the captives
distributed among the royal officers, who had
been sent hither at the king's cost, to see among
other things that the natives were not enslaved. Yet
Ayora was ill at ease. His dreams and meditations
were not pleasant; he knew that there must be a day
of reckoning when his atrocities became known. The
villain determined to escape before the return of the
captains. Making ready with his men, he watched
his opportunity, and seizing one of the ships lying at
the anchorage, not unknown to the governor however,
as many think, he escaped with his booty. Peter
Martyr, while acknowledging a long acquaintance with
Ayora, says that "in all the turmoyles and tragicall
affayres of the Ocean, nothing hath so muche displeased
me, as the couetousnesse of this man, who
hath so disturbed the pacified minds of the Kinges."
And "if Juan de Ayora had been punished for his
many injuries to the peaceable caciques," wrote Vasco
Nuñez subsequently to the king, "the other captains
would not have dared to commit like excesses."<a id='FA_X-20' href='#FN_X-20' class='fnanchor'>[X-20]</a>
</p>

<p>
The chronicles continue in about the same strain.
Shortly after Ayora, Francisco Becerra came in from
the hunt with gold to the value of seven thousand pesos
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_403' href='#Page_403'>403</a></span>
de oro, and with over one hundred captives, by the
judicious distribution of which official inquiry was not
only quieted, but Becerra obtained a new commission.
He was sent with one hundred and eighty men and
three pieces of artillery to Cenú, to avenge the death
of forty-eight men lost by Francisco de Vallejo some
time before. It was here that Enciso once attempted
to violate the native sepulchres in search of golden
ornaments. Becerra went with the determination to
spare neither age nor sex; but, on landing, the party
was decoyed into ambush and every man of them
slain by the poisoned arrows of the enemy, a native
servant-boy of Becerra alone escaping to carry the
news to Antigua.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">DESTRUCTION OF SANTA CRUZ.</div>

<p>
Since the whole region was in arms the eighty men
at Santa Cruz found it every day more difficult to
sustain life by stealing. Wherever the savages could
catch them they repaid their cruelties in kind, cutting
off the limbs with sharp stones, or pouring melted
gold down their throats, crying "Eat! Eat gold,
Christians! take your fill of gold!"<a id='FA_X-21' href='#FN_X-21' class='fnanchor'>[X-21]</a>
</p>

<p>
Growing yet bolder, Pocorosa collected a large
force and captured the fort, five Spaniards only escaping
to Antigua.<a id='FA_X-22' href='#FN_X-22' class='fnanchor'>[X-22]</a> Thus within six months after establishing
Santa Cruz, not a vestige of the settlement
remained.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">TELLO DE GUZMAN AND ALBITES.</div>

<p class="p2">
Antonio Tello de Guzman was sent with one hundred
men to continue the work abandoned by Ayora.
Departing from Antigua early in November, 1515, he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_404' href='#Page_404'>404</a></span>
proceeded to the province of Tubanamá<a id='FA_X-23' href='#FN_X-23' class='fnanchor'>[X-23]</a> and found
the fortress, in command of Captain Meneses, besieged
by the savages, and the garrison reduced to
the last extremity. The place was abandoned, and
Meneses marched southward with Guzman into the
provinces of Chepo and Chepauri. There they were
met by several caciques combined to oppose them;
but the savages were persuaded to think better of it.
Chepo presented his visitors with a large amount of
gold and feasted them. While seated at dinner a
young cacique rushed in greatly excited and denounced
the host as a usurper, who had defrauded him of his
inheritance. "Reinstate me," he urged, "and I will
give you twice the gold Chepo has given." The
argument was irresistible. Chepo was hanged; seven
of his principal men were given to the dogs, and the
adjudicators received gold to the value of six thousand
pesos. Then they went their way.
</p>

<p>
As they approached the seaboard they heard a place
much spoken of which the natives called Panamá. It
must be that gold or pearls were there, the Spaniards
thought; for how otherwise could any place be famous?
On reaching it, however, they were disappointed to
find only a collection of fishermen's huts, the word
<i>panamá</i>, in the aboriginal tongue, signifying "a place
where many fish are taken."<a id='FA_X-24' href='#FN_X-24' class='fnanchor'>[X-24]</a> Resting here with part
of his company, Tello de Guzman despatched Diego
de Albites with eighty men to the rich province of
Chagre, ten leagues distant; and this captain plumes
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_405' href='#Page_405'>405</a></span>
himself, and we permit him in God's name, that he did
not murder the sleepy savages when, roused at dead
of night, they gazed with stolid astonishment on their
strange visitors, and promptly paid twelve hundred
pesos for the privilege to be left alive. Acquiring
so much so easily, Albites deemed it only proper to
demand more, and handing another large sack to the
cacique, he told him to fill it with gold. "I can fill
your sack with stones from the brook," was the reply,
"but I cannot make gold, neither have I any more."
Even for this the good Albites did not cast him to
the dogs, but took his departure for Pacora,<a id='FA_X-25' href='#FN_X-25' class='fnanchor'>[X-25]</a> where
joined by Guzman the entire company returned to
Tubanamá.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>
Thus far the expedition of Tello de Guzman had
been prosperous, and more important than he himself
imagined, for his was the first visit of Spaniards to
the site of the afterwards renowned city of Panamá.
Hence to Antigua, however, the march was distressing.
Elated by his success at Santa Cruz, Pocorosa
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_406' href='#Page_406'>406</a></span>
appeared at Tubanamá; with an increased force.
Hoisting as banners the bloody raiment of slain
Christians, the savages brandished their gory pennons
on every hillside, crying, "Behold the fate of
the accursed, who leave their homes to mar the peace
of unoffending nations." All along down the mountain
and over the burning plain of Darien to the very
threshold of Antigua, the Spaniards fought a hidden
foe, who never offered pitched battle, but so harassed
them that ofttimes they were on the point of
throwing away their heavy plates of gold, and lying
down to die from thirst, hunger, and exhaustion.
Nevertheless they arrived at Antigua with many
slaves and much treasure.
</p>

<p class="p2">
All this time Vasco Nuñez was left in the background;
and while such dastardly doings were in
order it was as well for every honorable man to remain
unoccupied. It was hard, however, to remain idle;
and in an evil moment, at the earnest solicitations
of the old comrades who had no confidence in any
other leader, he consented to take part in another
expedition to Dabaiba, in search of the gold and the
golden temple there. It was a desperate undertaking,
as the former adventure had proved, but the colony
was an Ixion's wheel that kept the government ever
moving.
</p>

<p>
When two hundred men were ready, and the question
of leadership arose, Pedrarias named Luis Carrillo;
but there were those who would not go except
under Vasco Nuñez. Then it occurred to the governor
to divide the leadership in such a way that
if the expedition proved successful his own captain
should have the credit, and if a failure, the blame
should fall upon his enemy. And so it was arranged,
to the infinite disgust of Balboa, who plainly saw the
governor's purpose, and would have declined could
he have done so without prejudice to his friends.
Embarking in June, 1515, and ascending the Atrato
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_407' href='#Page_407'>407</a></span>
for some distance, the expedition was suddenly surrounded
by hostile canoes which darted simultaneously
from beneath the foliage overhanging either
bank. The Spaniards were taken at a disadvantage;
for beside attacking them with wooden lances the savages,
who were more expert upon the water than the
Spaniards, dived under and overturned their canoes,
to the destruction of one half the expedition. Among
the lost was Luis Carrillo. The one hundred survivors
found their way back to Antigua with no small difficulty.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">EXPEDITION UP THE ATRATO.</div>

<p>
One might think that this would be enough of
the golden temple for the present. But not so.
These men were not Castilians if danger and defeat
acted otherwise than as stimulants to new adventure.
Furthermore, like the honors of the arena which are
magnified by the difficulties of their attainment, the
mysterious dominion so stubbornly defended must hold
great treasure, and in the inflamed minds of the Spaniards
the savage pantheon of Dabaiba had risen into
a lofty edifice glittering with gold and gems, and situated
in a region rich and beautiful beyond comparison.
And Juan de Tabira, the factor, was confident he could
capture it, as likewise was Juan de Birues the inspector.
They would build three light brigantines; and with
these, and a small fleet of canoes, and, say one hundred
and sixty men, bid defiance to the demon host of Dabaiba.
This they did, Tabira commanding. The cost
fell heavy on the factor, but the king's chest helped
him out, if Herrera speaks truly.
</p>

<p>
As hitherto, the invaders were attacked, but the savages
were easily beaten off. Not so the goddess of the
golden temple, who sent such a flood as uprooted trees,
overturned the factor's vessel, and drowned among
others both Tabira and Birues. Francisco Pizarro
being of the party was asked to assume command and
continue up the river, but he declined, and further
efforts in that direction were abandoned.<a id='FA_X-26' href='#FN_X-26' class='fnanchor'>[X-26]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_408' href='#Page_408'>408</a></span>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">A VISIT TO THE PEARL ISLANDS.</div>

<p>
Rumors arriving from Spain of the recognition
by the India Council of the services and merits of
Vasco Nuñez, Pedrarias hastened to move men to
the southern seaboard, lest he should see his enemy
placed in power there. For this mission were chosen
the governor's cousin, Gaspar de Morales, and Francisco
Pizarro, to whom were given sixty men.<a id='FA_X-27' href='#FN_X-27' class='fnanchor'>[X-27]</a> They
were told to cross the mountains by the shortest
route, and, taking possession of the Pearl Islands
found and named by Vasco Nuñez, to gather the fruit
thereof. The object of the Europeans in attacking
the islanders was, of course, to extend the boundaries
of their enlightened, just, and humane civilization,
and bring the benighted heathen to a knowledge of
the Christian religion. True, they might gather a
little gold, or pick up such pearls as fell in their way,
for the laborer is worthy of his hire.
</p>

<p>
On reaching the seashore, Morales quartered half
of his men, under Peñalosa, on a cacique named Tutibrá,
and the remainder on the neighboring chieftain,
Tunaca. Chiapes and Tumaco, still loyal to the
Spaniards, joined them there. Every requisite, food,
boats, and men, was provided by the savages with
alacrity, for they who should despoil their ancient
enemy were welcome.
</p>

<p>
One day, just before dark, Morales and Pizarro
with thirty Spaniards and a large company of natives
embarked in a fleet of canoes, but so boisterous was
the sea that they were unable to reach the islands
before the next day. Landing on one of the smaller
islands and meeting but slight resistance, the invaders
passed over to Isla Rica, as it was called by Vasco
Nuñez, the largest of the group, where dwelt the
terrible king, who made the caciques of the mainland
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_409' href='#Page_409'>409</a></span>
tremble, and who now, nothing daunted, came forward
at the head of his warriors and fought the
strangers bravely. And notwithstanding Castilian
gunpowder, steel, and bloodhounds heaping in lifeless
masses before his eyes his best and bravest, the stubborn
king fought on as if he knew not how to yield.
Finally Chiapes and Tumaco spoke to him, and showed
how vain resistance was, how valuable the friendship
of the strangers. Believing this, the island
monarch submitted, and brought the Spaniards to
the spacious palace, as the old chroniclers called his
house, and set before them a basket of large and
lustrous pearls to satisfy their avaricious souls. In
return the king was made passing rich by a present
of a few cheap hand-mirrors, some hawk-bells and
hatchets, and exhibited almost as foolish a delight
over his trinkets as did the Europeans over theirs.
"Commend me to the friendship of these gods," cried
the king, as he sought his swarthy other self behind
the mirror, and jingled the hawk-bells, so much more
beautiful than pearls, and tried the keen edge of his
hatchet on the skull of a slave standing by. Embracing
Morales he led him to a tower which crowned
the dwelling, and commanded a view of the isle-dotted
ocean on every side. "Behold," he said, "the
infinite sea extending beyond the sunbeams; behold
these islands on the right hand and on the left. All
are mine; all abound in pearls, whereof you shall
have as many as desired if you continue my friend."
He also spoke of the nations of the distant mainland
whose mighty power was evidenced by the ships which
he had sometimes seen.
</p>

<p>
Morales readily promised eternal friendship, stipulating
only that one hundred marks of pearls should
be annually paid the king of Castile, and to this
assented the king of Dites,<a id='FA_X-28' href='#FN_X-28' class='fnanchor'>[X-28]</a> as the natives called Isla
Rica. In order, so far as possible, to render insignificant
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_410' href='#Page_410'>410</a></span>
the achievement of Vasco Nuñez, Morales had
been instructed to take possession of the South Sea
for the king of Spain in the name of Pedrarias. This
was now done. The name of Isla de Flores was substituted
for that of Isla Rica, and the holy rite of
baptism was administered to the king, who received
the name Pedro Arias.<a id='FA_X-29' href='#FN_X-29' class='fnanchor'>[X-29]</a>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">MISFORTUNES OF MORALES.</div>

<p>
The good fortune of Morales now forsook him.
On returning to the mainland he found that the country
was in arms, owing to the excesses of Peñalosa,
who was a relative of Isabel, wife of Pedrarias. The
villain had repaid the hospitality of Tutibrá by outrages
on his women, and the chieftains had in consequence
confederated for the protection of their homes.
In revenge for this Morales spread fire and sword
throughout that region. On one occasion eighteen
caciques, called to a friendly council, were treacherously
seized and given to the dogs; at another time seven
hundred savages are said to have been slain within an
hour. But in burning the village of a cacique named
Birú,<a id='FA_X-30' href='#FN_X-30' class='fnanchor'>[X-30]</a> on the eastern side of the gulf, the Spaniards
were repulsed, and in attempting to cross the mountains
to Darien they lost their way, and after considerable
wandering and suffering found themselves back
at the starting-point. Again they essayed the transit,
a handful of men amidst infuriated hosts. In retaliation
for night attacks, and darts showered by day
from cliffs and thickets, the Europeans strewed their
path with murdered and mutilated captives to the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_411' href='#Page_411'>411</a></span>
number of one hundred, hoping to intimidate the
enemy, who was only the more maddened thereby.
Thus, midst this bloody disturbance, which in ferocity
far exceeded anything of which wild beasts are capable,
this band of Spanish marauders escaping their
just deserts, managed with great tribulation to reach
their settlement, still clinging to the gold and pearls.<a id='FA_X-31' href='#FN_X-31' class='fnanchor'>[X-31]</a>
</p>

<p>
To Gaspar de Morales Vasco Nuñez pays the same
encomiums as to the other captains of Pedrarias. "Be
it known to your Majesty," he writes, "that during
this excursion was perpetrated the greatest cruelty
ever heard of in Arabian or Christian country, in any
generation. And this it is. This captain and the surviving
Christians while on their journey took nearly
one hundred Indians of both sexes, mostly women and
children, fastened them with chains, and afterward
ordered them to be decapitated and scalped." But
"being cousin and servant of the governor," adds
Oviedo, he suffers "neither pain nor punishment."

While these expeditions were directed to the east

</p>

<p>
Gonzalo de Badajoz embarked at Antigua for the
South Sea in March, 1515, with one hundred and
thirty men.<a id='FA_XI-1' href='#FN_XI-1' class='fnanchor'>[XI-1]</a> Landing at Nombre de Dios, where no
white man had touched since Nicuesa's departure,
a dismal spectacle was there presented. The dismantled
fort stood surrounded by tenantless dwellings,
whose walls were once the silent witnesses of
despair; while crosses, heaps of stone, and dead men's
scattered bones, seemed to tell how restless were
these adventurers even in their last resting. The
most impassive of all that callous company was struck
by a momentary shudder as he gazed on these ghastly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_413' href='#Page_413'>413</a></span>
portents of his own probable fate; and they would
have turned back on the spot had not their leader
hurried the ships away beyond their reach.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">ADVENTURES OF BADAJOZ.</div>

<p>
The versatile adventurer quickly recovers himself,
however, and what is more wonderful is the indifference
with which sanguinary recitals often repeated
are soon received. The homely adage that familiarity
breeds contempt is nowhere more strikingly true than
in our own intercourse with danger, pain, and death.
It is not altogether a Hibernicism to say that men
get used to these things, even to hanging. And
when the oft-repeated disasters are distant, and only
the survivors with their prizes are present, the terrible
tale makes still less impression. That colony
after colony in the New World occupation should be
swept away or divided by death, and divided yet
again, ten times, or twenty times cut in twain; or
that expedition after expedition should return to Antigua,
leaving half or two thirds of its number rotting
on the heated plain, or scattered in the mountains
furnishing food for carrion-birds, and yet new colonists
continue to come out, and new expeditions continue
to be organized by those willing to take the
same even chances of never returning, shows an ignorance,
or indifference, or both, to which fear of consequences
is as inaccessible as ever was the feeling of
love to Narcissus.
</p>

<p>
The mission of Badajoz was the usual one. He
was to cross the Isthmus at its narrowest part, take
possession of the country, and gather in its treasures.
We all know what this implied. Were any but civilized
Christians so to do it would be called murder,
robbery, treachery, violation, and the rest.
</p>

<p>
Totonagua was the first victim on this occasion.
His dominions were of great extent and thickly peopled,
the village where he resided standing on the
mountains opposite Nombre de Dios. Surprised by
night he surrendered gold to the value of six thousand
pesos. Tataracherubi, a wealthy cacique on the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_414' href='#Page_414'>414</a></span>
southern side, was similarly relieved of gold to the
value of eight thousand pesos. Seeing the Spaniards
so deeply in love with gold, Tataracherubi told them
of a chief named Natá, some distance to the south-west,
very rich and with few fighting men. Thirty
men under Alonso Perez de la Rua were deemed
ample for the adventure, but after a night's march
the Spaniards found themselves, as morning broke,
in the midst of a cluster of villages belonging to a
numerous and warlike people. Retreat was impossible,
and not a moment was to be lost. Rushing
for the principal village they seized the leading cacique,
Natá,<a id='FA_XI-2' href='#FN_XI-2' class='fnanchor'>[XI-2]</a> and were masters of the situation. For
when the savages pressed them hard in the fight that
followed, and would have slain them all, they threatened
Natá with instant death if he did not cause his
men to lay down their arms. Natá obeyed. Presently
Badajoz joined Perez, and the chief was released
to collect for his captors gold in value to fifteen
thousand castellanos. After remaining at Natá two
months the conquerors surprised the village of Escoria,
ten leagues to the southward, and secured gold<a id='FA_XI-3' href='#FN_XI-3' class='fnanchor'>[XI-3]</a>
to the value of nine thousand pesos. Westward from
Escoria lived Biruquete<a id='FA_XI-4' href='#FN_XI-4' class='fnanchor'>[XI-4]</a> and a blind neighbor, who
were relieved of six thousand pesos worth of gold.
In the vicinity were the villages of Taracuri, Pananome,
Tabor, and Chirú, where the Spaniards obtained
another considerable quantity of gold.
</p>

<p>
Gonzalo de Badajoz was gathering a rich harvest.
Thus far his accumulations reached eighty thousand
castellanos, equivalent to more than half a million of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_415' href='#Page_415'>415</a></span>
dollars at the present day. It was not a disagreeable
way of making money. It was quite honorable stealing
in the eyes of the plunderers themselves, although
the stupid savages never could wholly make out the
right of it. In addition to gold there were always
plenty of women for slavery, and so the adventurers
who for these benefits had staked their lives were happy.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CACIQUE PARIS.</div>

<p>
Elated by their successes, the conquerors continued
the good work. Not far from Chirú were the dominions
of a cacique called by the Spaniards Parizao Pariba,
subsequently abbreviated into Paris.<a id='FA_XI-5' href='#FN_XI-5' class='fnanchor'>[XI-5]</a> Advised
of their approach Paris fled to the mountains with
all his people and treasure. Badajoz sent a message
threatening to put the dogs upon his track unless
he returned. Paris returned word that he was exceedingly
occupied and hoped the Spanish captain
would excuse his coming. He begged him, however,
to accept an accompanying gift from his women, and
wished him a prosperous journey out of the country.
The gift so carelessly presented was carried by four
principal men in baskets made of the withes of palm-leaves
and lined with deerskins. In dimensions they
were about one and a half by two feet, and three
inches in depth. The contents consisted of fabricated
gold, breast-plates, bracelets and ear-rings, valued, as
the Spaniards affirmed, at forty or fifty thousand castellanos.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption hidepub"> <a href="images/i-490lg.png">View larger image</a>
</p>
</div>

<p>
So much treasure so royally presented only excited
their cupidity the more. Thanking the savages, Badajoz
retired with his men, but as soon as Paris
returned to the village, he surprised it at night and
obtained as much more gold as had already been
sent. This greediness resulted in their ruin. Paris
sent out upon the road one of his principal men who
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_416' href='#Page_416'>416</a></span>
was instructed, when captured, to pass himself off as
belonging to an adjoining village, three leagues distant,
and to say that it was well stocked with gold.
He was on his way to the river to fish, but would
show them his town. The strategy succeeded. Badajoz
sent a portion of the men under his guidance to
bring in the treasure. Meanwhile Paris had raised
an army of four thousand warriors, and the invaders
being now divided, as had been designed, he fiercely
attacked and almost exterminated one part before
the other could join it. The Spaniards fought until
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_417' href='#Page_417'>417</a></span>
seventy of their number were slain, whereupon they
abandoned the treasure, cut their way through the
savages, and fled to the territory of Chame.<a id='FA_XI-6' href='#FN_XI-6' class='fnanchor'>[XI-6]</a> Thence
they crossed to an island occupied by Tabor, and
afterward to Taboga Island, where they remained for
thirty days recruiting their strength for the desperate
attempt to reach Darien. This they finally accomplished,
but Perez de la Rua lost his life immediately
on returning to the mainland. Since they failed to
bring home the gold of which their stories were full,

<div class="sidenote">ATTACK ON CENÚ.</div>

<p class="p2">
The year 1515 was now drawing toward its close.
It had been clouded with more than one disaster,
and Pedrarias was anything but pleased. Himself a
fighting man as well as civil officer, he determined to
show his young captains what an old man could do in
the field; for whatever his general character, and it
was detestable enough, Pedrarias was not a coward.
His first blow was to be directed against the Cenú
people, toward whom he had not felt kindly since
the slaughter of the two companies under Vallejo
and Becerra. What right had these savages to kill
Spaniards? And yet were his purpose known of
entering within range of those poisoned arrows he
would have few followers to the wars. An expedition
of three hundred men was therefore organized
ostensibly against Pocorosa, and with this he coasted
westward until after night-fall, when he ordered the
pilots to turn back and make for Cenú, whose tristful
shore the next morning saw them close approaching.
Anchoring, Hurtado was sent with two hundred men
to fire the village and do what killing was convenient.
He managed to cut in pieces a few women and children
as they escaped the flames, and secure some captives
for slaves, but the poisoned arrows soon terminated
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_418' href='#Page_418'>418</a></span>
the sport, and the expedition turned again toward
the province of Pocorosa.
</p>

<p>
The purpose of the governor was to found at least
two posts of the line ordained by the king, but
which his captains had failed to establish. Pedrarias
resolved that the termini of the intended line on
either ocean should be at once selected and town-building
begun. Coasting westward in search of a
site he came to a pleasant port, northward of Careta,
beyond which extended a dry and fertile plain with
timber suitable for ship-building, and from which led
a now well-known route across the Isthmus. The
natives called the place Acla,<a id='FA_XI-7' href='#FN_XI-7' class='fnanchor'>[XI-7]</a> that is to say, 'Bones
of Men.' There the governor began to build a wooden
fort with such enthusiasm as not only to direct the
laborers, but to assist them with his hands, until
excess of zeal brought on a fever which rendered it
necessary for him to be carried bedridden to Antigua.
Gabriel de Rojas was left in command of the unfinished
enterprise, and Gaspar de Espinosa with a stout
force was permitted to try the fortunes of war on
that permanent object of the spoiler, Pocorosa.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LICENTIATE'S ASS.</div>

<p>
It seems that the youthful magistrate on finding
his official duties spiritless without the mellow growl
and inane wit of pettifogger or pundit, had laid aside
the long-robe and buckled on the sword, this being in
his opinion the more significant emblem in the arbitration
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_419' href='#Page_419'>419</a></span>
of Indian affairs. And as the highest wisdom is
that which adapts learning to the duties of the day,
the licentiate would not be bound by the mechanical
restrictions which governed the illiterate cavaliers in
their encounters with the natives. There are some
whom travel improves but little, though like Haddad
Ben Ahab, they should climb to the top of the world's
wall and look down the other side. Our juvenile judge
was not one of these. <i>Bonum est fugienda adspicere
in alieno malo</i>, was his motto. It is good to note in
the misfortunes of others what we should avoid, for
so Publius Syrus has said. He would go to the
wars as a warrior, not plodding his way wearily over
mountain and through morass, like a common foot-soldier,
but he would enter the domain of the enemy
mounted, and in a manner becoming a general and
a judge. Athena went to war mounted on a lion,
Alexander on a horse, Espinosa on—an ass. History
gives the licentiate this honor, and as an honest man
I cannot deny it him; he was the first to cross the
Isthmus on an ass. Some horses had of late been
brought to Antigua, which were employed to a very
limited extent in the wars of Tierra Firme and also
on the present occasion; but the alcalde mayor preferred
to bestride an ass; it was a more judicial beast,
not say surer-footed or more safe. Moreover, it was
staid, and not liable to rush recklessly into battle.
There was another advance. Several pieces of artillery
were dragged across the Isthmus in this expedition.
</p>

<p>
When the savages first beheld the conquering hero
borne triumphantly through crowds of admiring spectators,
they fell back dumbfounded. They knew the
force of Spanish steel; bloodhounds they knew, and
arquebuses vomiting fire and hurling thunderbolts.
But what was this? Its eyes were not fiery, nor its
nostrils distended, nor its teeth flesh-tearing. Its countenance
betokened mildness, and mind-absence, such
as attend benevolent contemplation; there was in it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_420' href='#Page_420'>420</a></span>
nothing of that refined lust or voracious piety which
characterized the faces of the Spaniards. And surely
Apollo was in error when he gave Midas such ears
because he could not appreciate music. For listen to
its notes. Ah, that voice! When Sir Balaam lifted
up his voice the savages fled in terror. Tremblingly
they returned and enquired for what the creature was
asking. The Spaniards replied that he was asking
for gold; and during the campaign his musical beast
brought the licentiate more gold than did ever Leoncico
earn for Vasco Nuñez. And throughout that
region the learned licentiate became known to the
natives by the noble animal that he bestrode, so
much so that those who entered the Spaniard's camp
to see the general used to announce their object by
braying like an ass, an appeal to which the chief
officer ever obligingly responded.
</p>

<p class="p2">
As alcalde mayor it was the duty of Espinosa at all
times and in all places to administer the law. For so
God and the king had commanded; so he had sworn
to do. Now it was often somewhat inconvenient to
rob and murder at pleasure, even under the liberal
provisions of the king's Requirement, according to
the governor's ideas of business. Therefore it was
deemed wise and prudent to issue an edict from the
imperial city of Antigua declaring all Americans in
arms against the Europeans to be outlaws, doomed
to slavery, mutilation, or death. Those who had
taken part in the destruction of Santa Cruz should
be burned; and it was quite remarkable in so young
a jurist how quickly he determined, no matter how
distant the evidence, whenever the destruction of a
people, while promoting the sovereignty of law, would
at the same time yield profit to the lawgiver.
</p>

<p>
The judge had not proceeded far upon his new
circuit before he met Badajoz, who was returning
dejectedly to Antigua, suffering from the effects of
excessive cupidity. Informed of the immense treasure
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_421' href='#Page_421'>421</a></span>
Badajoz had failed to bring back, Espinosa wrote
Pedrarias for more men that he might go and gather
it. Badajoz claimed the command as a right; but
Pedrarias said, "Not so; Espinosa is alcalde mayor;
furthermore, Captain Badajoz brings back neither
slaves nor gold wherewith to purchase favor." With
this the licentiate received one hundred and thirty
additional men under Gerónimo Valenzuela. So great
was becoming the abhorrence of the colonists for these
hazardous and unholy adventures that this captain,
in conformity to his instructions, scuttled his ship on
reaching Acla, in order to deprive the men of the
means for returning to Antigua.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Cæsar's Commentaries on the Gallic wars are not
more minute in detail than the narration<a id='FA_XI-8' href='#FN_XI-8' class='fnanchor'>[XI-8]</a> of incidents
during this expedition as given by Espinosa to the
governor. The licentiate was exceedingly careful in
every instance, first of all to propitiate the law by
observing its smallest letter, such as reading and expounding
the king's Requirement, and never to rob
or kill the natives except in the name of the king of
Spain, and the rights of man. His judicial conscience
thus quieted, he went to work with a will.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEPOPULATION OF THE PROVINCES.</div>

<p>
The provinces of Pocorosa and Comagre were at
this time almost depopulated, and the licentiate could
with difficulty obtain food for the men or exercise
for his arms. On the approach of the Spaniards,
the poor remnants of these once happy nations fled
affrighted to their hiding-places. This the learned
licentiate ruled <i>ipso jure</i> a declaration of hostilities;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_422' href='#Page_422'>422</a></span>
in a word, if the law could not be twisted to fit the
occasion, the chief guardian of the law, himself turned
law-breaker and spoiler, was as ready to throw overboard
the law as was the most lawless cavalier.
Whole nations, I say, were declared outlaws by the
honorable chief judge, because they would not come
forward and embrace slavery of their own free will.
If any fugitives were particularly hard to catch, that
was proof of participation in the Santa Cruz affair, and
they were burned according to law.
</p>

<p>
The caprice of the law, however, does not exhibit
the pretensions of civilization and Christianity in
these parts in their grossest absurdity. In the outrageous
raids under Pedrarias, the most revolting
crimes were committed in the name of religion. The
itching palm of Quevedo, the bishop, has been more
than once referred to; and now we see his dean actually
enter the field of inhumanity in person against
the unhappy natives. The licentiate writes: "We
proceeded on our way about one league and a half to
Poquina's land, where the Indians set fire to their
huts and ran away. I sent the dean with one squad,
and Ojeda with another, and they brought back some
Indians, the number whereof will appear in the distribution.
I gave Chiarna some of these Indians, and
that overpaid him for the provisions he had furnished
us." Unfortunately this is not the only instance we
are doomed to encounter in this history, of a priest
disgracing the faith by placing himself beside bloodhounds
and bloody-minded men, and joining a hunt,
in Christ's name, to bring innocent men and women
and children to slavery and death.
</p>

<p>
After sending to Santa Cruz in the hope of finding
provisions from Antigua, "we went to the province
of Tamame," continues Espinosa, "whence I sent all
the captains to explore the Rio Grande,<a id='FA_XI-9' href='#FN_XI-9' class='fnanchor'>[XI-9]</a> on both
banks, as I had been informed that Pocorosa's people
were there hiding. Some Indians were caught, as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_423' href='#Page_423'>423</a></span>
will appear in the distribution, five of whom were
burnt to ashes, on confessing their participation in
the murders of Santa Cruz." Indeed, "I used to
send men after the Indians, and justice was done
upon all those who had participated in the Santa
Cruz outrage, either by hanging or burning, and two
were shot off from the cannon's mouth the more to
frighten them."
</p>

<div class="sidenote">ESPINOSA ON THE PACIFIC.</div>

<p>
Crossing the Cordillera by way of Tubanamá and
Chepo to Panamá, where he hoped to obtain food,
but found only some huts and one woman, Espinosa
passed on to Chirú, sending out his captains in every
direction for plunder. At Chame the Spaniards found
only four Indians; and as the chief had furnished corn
to Badajoz, they did not molest him. The cacique
of Chirú was captured with his women and gold, by
Hurtado, but appearing peaceable he was liberated,
and made the custodian of some slaves, and ornaments
for the mass, for a church was to be organized on the
shores of Pacific. Chirú sent Espinosa iguanas to eat,
and <i>chicha</i>, fish, deer, and salt, and was given some
hammocks in return.
</p>

<p>
After this the Spaniards charged on Natá one night,
securing one hundred captives, and gold to the value
of fifteen hundred castellanos. The cacique escaped,
and rallying his warriors prepared to attack the Spaniards;
but when the natives saw the horses they fled
in terror, fearing that they would be torn in pieces by
them. As it was, the horsemen pursued the fugitives
and hewed them down in great numbers. Espinosa
marvelled at the multitudes of people he here encountered,
and at the number of their villages. He
found also an abundance of maize, fish, and deer, and
there were geese and turkeys. Four months' supply of
corn was at once secured for the army; and for better
protection during the sojourn palisades were erected.
</p>

<p>
One morning while the licentiate was reposing in
his lodge, Natá with one attendant rushed unceremoniously
into his presence, desperation depicted in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_424' href='#Page_424'>424</a></span>
their countenances, and with empty quivers in their
hands. "You are too strong for me," cried the chief.
"You have taken my warriors, my wives, my children;
do with me as you please." Espinosa received him
kindly, returned him his wives and children, and told
him to bring his people from their hiding-places and
fear nothing. The gold which had been taken from
Badajoz was then demanded of him, but Natá denied
having any of it, saying that Paris had kept it all.
Being well established here the Spaniards proceeded
against the neighboring provinces. The people fled,
but were compelled by hunger to return. Among the
captives taken some were employed in planting, and
if any became unruly they were hanged. Others assisted
in building a little chapel, for the zealous dean
had now sheathed his bloody sword to preach through
an interpreter the glad tidings of good-will to man,
and many were baptized.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile a deputation composed of the natives
of Natá was sent to the cacique Paris, demanding his
allegiance to the king of Spain, and the restoration
of the gold taken from Badajoz. Paris replied by
hanging all the ambassadors, save two, by whom he
sent back word that every Christian caught within
his territories would be treated in like manner. The
licentiate prepared immediately to march against the
redoubtable chieftain.
</p>

<p>
On the 29th of July, 1516, every member of the
army was confessed by the priest. Vows were made
to Our Lady of Antigua, "and in the name of God,"
says the licentiate, "we began our journey." Hurtado
had been sent with fifty men to Escoria, and the ruler
of that province together with Chirú and Natá was
forced to accompany the expedition against Paris.<a id='FA_XI-10' href='#FN_XI-10' class='fnanchor'>[XI-10]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_425' href='#Page_425'>425</a></span>
The inhabitants melted before the invaders, and it
was with difficulty that men could be captured for
guides. The Spaniards had not advanced far before
they learned that a council had been held by the chiefs
confederated for self-protection, to determine whether
the gold taken from Badajoz should be returned.
Some were in favor of restoring it; but others objected
that, this being given up, as much more would be demanded,
and since fight they must in either case, it
was agreed to do so before surrendering the treasure.
It so happened that Diego Albites with eighty men
was marching in advance, and coming to a rivulet
he espied some Indians hidden under the bank and
undertook to capture them. Instantly the country
was alive with savages; Albites found himself surrounded
by four thousand of the enemy, wholly cut
off from the main body. The Spaniards fought desperately
for six hours, and would have been destroyed
had not Espinosa appeared and let loose upon the
assailants the bloodhounds and the horsemen. Twenty
caciques and a host of warriors were slain, and many
of the Spaniards were badly wounded. "That night
we slept upon the battle-field," says Espinosa, "and
next day I threw up a protection of palisades and sent
out in search of the cacique Paris." The cunning
chief had burned his village and fled, thus leaving the
invaders neither gold nor provisions. Albites went
out to forage, with instructions to fire a cannon in
case of danger. Nine times that night the licentiate
heard the report of a gun, and was not a little alarmed
for the safety of the captain. Great was his joy,
therefore, when early in the morning Valenzuela
appeared with reinforcement of one hundred men
from Antigua and informed the licentiate that it was
he who had fired the guns while in search of the
commander's camp.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">VALENZUELA JOINS ESPINOSA.</div>

<p class="p2">
Espinosa having now three hundred men felt himself
strong enough to prosecute discovery according
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_426' href='#Page_426'>426</a></span>
to the full tenor of his instructions, which were to
explore the coast westward as far as practicable.
As a first step he sent a detachment of eighty men
under Valenzuela into the province of Guararí, near
the seashore, in search of trees for canoes. Meanwhile
the treasure lost by Badajoz must if possible be
found before abandoning these parts. Companies were
sent out in various directions under Albites, Hurtado,
and Pedro de Gamez, between whom arose no small
rivalry for securing the honor of the capture. Their
purpose was to seize the caciques and wring from
them the secret by torture. At length Gamez came
upon the scent, and followed it into the province of
Quema. He was even so fortunate as to capture the
chief, but for want of an interpreter nothing definite
could be learned. He nevertheless reported favorably
to Espinosa, who ordered Albites and Hurtado to go
to his assistance. Under the gentle persuasion of the
rack Quema disclosed the place where part of the
gold, some thirty thousand castellanos, was hidden,
but denied any knowledge of the remainder. With
this gold and other plunder, the three captains rejoined
their commander, who had passed on to Guararí.
</p>

<p>
Two canoes being completed, each capable of carrying
seventy men, and three smaller ones having been
brought by Pablo Mejía from Chirú, they were placed
in charge of Bartolomé Hurtado, who with eighty or
ninety men coasted south and westward, while Espinosa
with the remainder of the company followed by
land. The rain fell in torrents, and the worthy licentiate
was soon tired of wading through the thick
mud; and so, after four days' march to a small port
called Huera,<a id='FA_XI-11' href='#FN_XI-11' class='fnanchor'>[XI-11]</a> in the province of Vera, a council was
held which arranged that Hurtado should continue
the survey with one hundred men, in boats, while the
land party should return to Quema and search for the
remainder of the Badajoz treasure.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="i-501"></a>

<p class="caption hidepub"> <a href="images/i-501lg.png">View larger image</a>
</p>
</div>

<p>
The first province at which Hurtado landed was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_427' href='#Page_427'>427</a></span>
called Guanata, whence the inhabitants had fled, and
where by reason of continuous rains the Spaniards
rested seven days. Securing guides they then passed
on to an island, called by the natives Caubaco, or
Cebaco,<a id='FA_XI-12' href='#FN_XI-12' class='fnanchor'>[XI-12]</a> three days distant. Hurtado was acquiring
experience, and found it better to treat these wild
people gently. This policy succeeded, and, although
his landing was at first opposed, he and the islanders
soon became the best of friends. Their ruler was
absent on the mainland, fighting; and when he
returned his subjects introduced the strangers with
such warmth that he at once extended his good-will,
giving Hurtado a golden armor valued at one thousand
castellanos. Indeed, he proved most affable and
accommodating, willing to acknowledge the king of
Spain, accept Christianity, or anything they desired;
so much so that the Spaniards called him Cacique
Amigo. An expedition was organized against the
inhabitants of a neighboring island, named by the
Spaniards Isla de Varones, in which they were joined
by Pequeari, brother of Cebaco, with nine canoes.
These islanders were found entrenched in a log
fortress, surrounded by a ditch, and so difficult to
carry that the assailants were repeatedly thrown back
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_428' href='#Page_428'>428</a></span>
and must have failed but for their artillery. Seven
leagues to the westward was an island called Cabo,<a id='FA_XI-13' href='#FN_XI-13' class='fnanchor'>[XI-13]</a>
where the Spaniards found a little gold. Thence
they kept along the mainland, but the inhabitants
were so fierce they dared not land. Some boatmen
told them, however, that through the lands of the
adjoining provinces, Torra and Tabraba, the distance
to the North Sea was but three days' journey. And
here they met with rumors of a rich and powerful
nation to the westward, with double faces and rounded
feet—an allusion probably to the table-land civilization.
There are people with the former characteristic even
to-day, and among our superior European culture.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">SOUTH SEA EXPLORATIONS.</div>

<p>
Hurtado explored the coast as far as the gulf of
Nicoya,<a id='FA_XI-14' href='#FN_XI-14' class='fnanchor'>[XI-14]</a> about one hundred and forty leagues from
Natá. In the vicinity of the Golfo Dulce,<a id='FA_XI-15' href='#FN_XI-15' class='fnanchor'>[XI-15]</a> the people
were called Chiuchires. The beauty and fruitfulness
of the country proved a constant temptation to
the Spaniards to land and dispute possession with the
owners, who appeared along the shore with drum and
trumpet to frighten the visitation. But such was not
Hurtado's purpose, nor his ability; from Nicoya he
returned to join Espinosa.
</p>

<p class="p2">
After due deliberation it was determined at Antigua
that the fishing station of Panamá<a id='FA_XI-16' href='#FN_XI-16' class='fnanchor'>[XI-16]</a> should be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_429' href='#Page_429'>429</a></span>
the site of the chief city, the terminal post of the
transcontinental line on the shore of the South Sea.
And after the return of Hurtado, which was early in
1517, Espinosa proceeded, under present instructions
from Pedrarias, to place an establishment there. Its
first commander was Hernan Ponce, who had just
returned with Hurtado from the Nicoya expedition.<a id='FA_XI-17' href='#FN_XI-17' class='fnanchor'>[XI-17]</a>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">GOLD HUNTING.</div>

<p>
During the absence of Hurtado, Espinosa had proceeded
to Quema in his search for Paris, and the
gold that Badajoz had lost, but he was soon obliged
to leave that province on account of the scarcity of
provisions. Two days' journey inland brought the
Spaniards to a village governed by a cacique called
Chiracona, who was accused of having been instrumental
in the defeat of Badajoz, and who now held
in his possession two of the baskets of gold. Into
this province, famous for the bravery of its men and
the beauty of its women, and also as being haunted
by <i>tuyraes</i>, or devils, Diego de Albites was sent forward
with sixty men, the remainder of the company
following at a slower march while feeding on reed
roots. "By God's will," says the pious licentiate,
"the cacique was captured with his women and children."
Chiracona at first denied the impeachment,
but when tortured he promised to produce the gold.
</p>

<p>
The poor fellow really knew nothing of the treasure,
but he saw that it was necessary for him to
confess something if he would live. And under the
pressure his wits quickened. According to tradition
the rendezvous of devils was a mountain fastness, ten
leagues distant, into which Tartarean retreat no man
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_430' href='#Page_430'>430</a></span>
had ever ventured. "If," thought the sadly battered
Chiracona, "these infernal Christians can be enticed
thither, there will be a happy end of them." But when
he told them of the beauty and fertility of the place,
and of the vast stores of wealth the ages had garnered
there, a woman of Escoria, whom the chaste licentiate
regarded with tender favor, besought her master not
to enter that dangerous recess, for she had heard say
that Chiracona sought only the destruction of the
Spaniards, confident that the earth would open to
swallow them. But the licentiate replied, "Have
no misgivings, amiga mia; Christians fear not devils;
devils fear Christians, and fly before them." And so
Pedro de Gamez was sent with seventy men to the
abode of the devils. The night following there was
a terrible earthquake: both heathen and Christian
believed his hour had come; and as Chiracona rode
in his house the oscillating earth, as in a canoe he
rode the billowy ocean, he smiled to think how well
his plan was working.
</p>

<p>
Next day Gamez returned without the gold; whereat
both white men and red were disappointed, the former
because the treasure was not forthcoming, the latter
because the Spanish had returned unharmed, since
this would beside require Chiracona to invent some
new pastime for their greedy avarice. The Spaniards
remained at this place two months, living on supplies
forced from Chiracona, and urging upon him Christianity,
allegiance to Spain, and the delivery of the
gold. Finding him obdurate on all these points, they
gave him to the dogs and went their way. Paris
being heard of at Quema, Diego de Albites was sent
thither, but was unsuccessful in the primary object
of his mission. The 2d of January, 1517, all passed
into Escoria, whence Albites was despatched on a three
days' journey to the northward to capture a cacique
named Tabraba. He was successful, and secured gold
to the value of four thousand castellanos.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">RETURN OF ESPINOSA TO ANTIGUA.</div>

<p>
Espinosa now made ready for returning to the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_431' href='#Page_431'>431</a></span>
North Sea. It filled him with indignation to witness
the ingratitude of the few caciques whose lives he
had spared. Natá apostatized, burned the Spaniards'
palisades, destroyed their growing grain, and joined a
hostile confederacy. The people of Chirú and elsewhere
retired, thus adding insult to the failure to
supply articles for plunder. While passing through
Tubanamá, Espinosa overthrew a chief named Chamna,
who had been hostile to Vasco Nuñez. In Comagre
he found Serrano, sent again to scourge that almost
desolate province. Half famished the Spaniards arrived
at Acla, and were overjoyed to find Vasco Nuñez,
who gave them food and provided them a vessel in
which to return to Antigua.
</p>

<p>
The alcalde mayor's were the mightiest stealings
of them all. Herrera estimates the returns of gold
at eighty thousand pesos, and two thousand captives
for slaves. After giving the king his fifth, and the
governor and officials each a liberal share, there was
enough distributed among the soldiers to make each
esteem himself rich. Then followed days and nights
of glorious debauch, in which, beside women and wine,
gambling was conspicuous. A second distribution of
capital was speedily effected under the auspices of the
goddess unfathomable. It was paltry to bet less than
a peso on any game, while a slave was a common
wager. The governor, his council, and the soldiers
took jovial parts in the exercise, and it is said that
Pedrarias at one sitting played away a hundred slaves.
It was of great avail, indeed, with such servants and
subjects, for the king to forbid playing-cards to be
sent to the New World, and for the Council of the
Indies to restrict a twenty-four hours' loss at play to
ten castellanos.

<p>
During Espinosa's absence in the south, affairs at
Antigua were exceptionally dull. The illness of the
governor, unfortunately, was not fatal. Business had
approached its end, for the fighting men were away,
and the thrifty arts offered few attractions to piratical
adventurers. So low was the colony at one time
reduced that the Casa de la Fundicion, or melting-house,
was closed and public fasts were appointed—a
homœopathic policy, in truth, for a starving community.
But for the feud between Pedrarias and
Vasco Nuñez, which in that infamous environment
was easily kept alive, little would have occurred
worthy of record.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">QUARRELS WITH THE GOVERNOR.</div>

<p>
It should be no fault of the governor if the cavalier
was not ruined. His choicest schemes were marred
by incompetent and evil-minded men. He was vilified
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_433' href='#Page_433'>433</a></span>
at court, and in the colony every indignity
possible was laid upon him. The observant reader
must already have drawn a contrast in the respective
quality of enterprise pursued by these men. Whatever
may have been the immediate results, whatever
the wrongs and cruelties inflicted by either, in the
one case there was the lofty aim of discovery and
peaceful occupation; in the other, no higher object
than plunder was apparent. Balboa had not time for
much gold-gathering; the captains of Pedrarias had
time for nothing else.
</p>

<p>
Excepting the raid of the alcalde mayor, the expeditions
planned by Pedrarias were not remarkable for
their success. Nor did Balboa scruple to rail at the
old governor in consequence. "All the enterprises
of Pedrarias met with such ill success," says Benzoni,
"that Balboa laughed at him and mocked him,
whereat the governor became irate, and serious contentions
resulted."
</p>

<p class="p2">
Balboa was now in the prime of manhood, approaching
forty, and had during the past few years developed
from a careless rambler into a thoughtful ruler, with
a New World fame second only to its first discoverer.
"Behold," says Peter Martyr, "this rash royster
turned into a politic captain, a violent Goliah transformed
to Heliseus, and from Anteus to Hercules
the conqueror of monsters." And of all monsters he
might encounter by sea or land, old man Pedrarias was
the most monstrous. It was exasperating beyond
endurance to an ardent and chivalrous nature like
Balboa's, thus to have his glories reaped and his
energies placed in circumscription by a superlatively
selfish person of far inferior natural abilities, made by
mistake his political superior. And he never ceased
to strike back with all the force at his command. By
every departure he appealed to the royal authorities
in Spain, laying before them vivid accounts of outrages
on the natives, perversion of the laws, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_434' href='#Page_434'>434</a></span>
gross mismanagement of the colony. "Most powerful
sovereign," he wrote the king, "I, a true and law-abiding
servant, sensible of the many obligations I
am under to do loyal service for benefits bestowed—and
may your Majesty live long to grant me more—humbly
desire to undeceive your Majesty regarding
the governor, Pedrarias Dávila, that your Majesty
may order such provisions as may be deemed best."
He urged Oviedo, when about to depart for Spain, to
place before the Council of the Indies the true condition
of things. And again he writes, "I beseech your
Majesty not to regard me as a calumniator, or as
stating aught in malice, but that you will order an
investigation, that you may know all I have said is
true." He still entertained hopes that the report of
Arbolancha, accompanied by the presents, would be
graciously received, and that his successes would atone
for past irregularities.
</p>

<p class="p2">
While awaiting the results of these endeavors, he
determined to make an expedition to the South Sea,
without permission or aid from Pedrarias, and to
extend his discoveries there in either direction. In
pursuance of this purpose, and with the coöperation
of the small remnant of those who had sworn fealty
on the heights of Quarequá, he secretly despatched
to Cuba for men and arms, a small vessel in charge
of Andrés Garabito. Having thus set in motion the
wheels of his fate, he awaited developments.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">ADELANTADO AND CAPTAIN-GENERAL.</div>

<p class="p2">
We have seen how King Ferdinand received Arbolancha,
how the royal heart was touched by
the discoveries and pearls of the generous cavalier.
And we must confess the monarch's dilemma. The
establishing of Pedrarias' government had cost him
much money, and the very qualities which achieved
desperate adventure tended to loosen the bonds of
allegiance. But Vasco Nuñez had manifested no disposition
to throw off royal authority; furthermore, it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_435' href='#Page_435'>435</a></span>
had become a principle of colonial economics, that the
services of successful commanders should be paid for
out of their future gains. How then could any sovereign
expect the extension of his dominions, if successful
adventure was defrauded of its right? It was
therefore determined that the reward of Vasco Nuñez
should be the title of adelantado of the Southern Sea,
and captain-general of the provinces of Coiba and
Panamá, but subject to the supervision of Pedrarias
as superior officer.
</p>

<p>
The royal despatches conferring this appointment
reached Antigua early in 1515, prior to the departure
of Espinosa. Pedrarias, of course, was at the same
time informed of the fact. His mortification was
only exceeded by his dastardly resolve. Take from
Castilla del Oro its southern seaboard and the government
was not worth the having, even though the
jurisdiction of Antigua did extend nominally over
the whole. The north coast was already stripped,
and the climate was such as no European could long
endure; while in the south wealth and dominion
awaited romantic adventure. All despatches arriving
at Antigua had to pass through the governor's
hands. Those for Vasco Nuñez on this occasion were
withheld.
</p>

<p>
Pedrarias well knew that some excuse would be
necessary for his conduct; and he began to look about
for one. It was unlawful in the provinces for any
governor or captain-general to exercise the functions
of office while undergoing his residencia. New
charges against the former governor of the colony
must therefore be invented, and litigious persecution
renewed. By collusion with the judge this investigation,
as the law then required, could be continued
indefinitely. Still better, the alcalde mayor, who was
the person most proper in this instance to take the
residencia, might be allured from his friendship for
the discoverer by the offer of a military command
after proceedings had been instituted, for it was well
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_436' href='#Page_436'>436</a></span>
known that the licentiate's vanity was not less than
his cupidity.
</p>

<p>
Believing himself prepared, the governor summoned
his council, revealed the secret, and urged that the
commission should be withheld. All agreed save
Bishop Quevedo, who had real friendship for Vasco
Nuñez, and who saw more honor for Spain and for
the Church in the elevation of the free-handed cavalier,
than in the military raid of the alcalde mayor. And
so seeing, he grew zealously virtuous, and began to
storm about it. Outnumbered in the council, he
mounted his pulpit and hurled invectives at his opponents.
"Can it be," he cried, "that the execrable
passions of envious and designing men may thus subvert
the royal design, and withhold the just reward
of eminent service?" Furthermore, he threatened
to spread the bare facts before the authorities in
Spain.
</p>

<p>
Pedrarias quailed. He had not anticipated the violent
opposition of the prelate, and he feared the rising
strength of his adversary, now that the royal favor
and a royal commission were known to have been
granted him. Vasco Nuñez might have his office,
but the old man swore it should be the death of him.
For he would lay around him such snares and pitfalls
as would surely prove his destruction in the
end. Pedrarias would be the power; and play upon
this braggart as he would upon a pipe for devils to
dance by.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">QUEVEDO AS MEDIATOR.</div>

<p class="p2">
The public acknowledgment of dignities, attended
by the congratulations of friends and the discussion
of southern projects in which alone interest now
centred, raised in popularity and importance the new
governor, to the overshadowing of the old one. But
once more the destiny of Vasco Nuñez is to turn on
the bad advice of a friend. Thrown upon himself, his
own sound judgment had ever been sufficient, but the
counsels of piety or erudition were as quicksand under
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_437' href='#Page_437'>437</a></span>
his feet. Quevedo induced him, for the sake of peace
and in order to enter without delay upon his South
Sea schemes, to waive in favor of Pedrarias some
portion of the rights the king had granted him. Espinosa
and others were accordingly permitted to overrun
the southern provinces at pleasure. This was a
mistake.
</p>

<p>
Thus reconciled, in appearance at least, Pedrarias
himself would fain have had rest, if it had been permitted
by his evil nature, which still demanded its
daily bitter pabulum.
</p>

<p>
Scarcely were these pacific fictions consummated
when the vessel of Andrés Garabito returned from
Cuba with men and supplies for the projected expedition
of Vasco Nuñez. Arriving off the coast of
Darien Garabito despatched a messenger to Balboa,
informing him of his return, and asking orders. It
soon reached the ears of Pedrarias that a suspicious-looking
craft, armed and equipped as if on some illicit
mission, lay hidden in a small bay some six leagues
distant. He was furthermore informed that the captain
of this vessel was in secret communication with
Vasco Nuñez, and that preparations were being made
for some mysterious undertaking. Pedrarias became
both frightened and furious. He called to mind the
fate of Nicuesa. Alarm for his own safety was mingled
with ire and envious regrets for ever having yielded
even in appearance to any recognition of this upstart's
titles and honors. He ordered the instant arrest of
Balboa, and even threatened to confine him for safe
keeping in the large wooden cage stationed in the
middle of the plaza.
</p>

<p>
The fears of Pedrarias were calmed, however, by
the cooler heads; the nature and purpose of the intended
expedition were explained; no lurking treason
was discovered, no plot against the peace of
Antigua or sinister designs upon the person of its
governor were found; and having bound himself to
new and more stringent restrictions, Vasco Nuñez was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_438' href='#Page_438'>438</a></span>
set at liberty, and the precarious friendship ostensibly
renewed.<a id='FA_XII-1' href='#FN_XII-1' class='fnanchor'>[XII-1]</a>
</p>

<p class="p2">
About this time the bishop of Darien was seized
with a luminous idea. Through his pertinacious devotedness
the worthy prelate had twice rescued his
friend from a life of independence and honor, and had
twice consigned him to the mercies of an insidious
enemy. He had prevented Pedrarias from sending
him in chains to Spain, which would have sounded
his renown and enlisted for him sympathy throughout
Christendom; he had persuaded him to relinquish his
rights to such an extent as to place his fortune at the
disposal of an inveterate foe. I do not say Quevedo
was an Ahithophel; yet the machinations of all his
enemies could not bring upon Vasco Nuñez the evils
consummated by this one friend. Nevertheless, the
present conception happily brought forth, and malice
and suspicion will forever give place to confiding
affection.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">BALBOA'S BETROTHAL.</div>

<p>
Four blooming daughters Pedrarias had left in
Spain. The health of the governor seemed to be
yielding before the combined influence of temper and
climate. Who could be a more fitting successor in
the government, and who a more suitable son-in-law?
Let Balboa take to wife Doña María, eldest daughter
of Pedrarias, and so bind the North Sea to the South
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_439' href='#Page_439'>439</a></span>
by cords of love. Such was the plan of the prelate.
Vasco Nuñez, nothing loath, assented, for the daughter
was as amiable as the father was malicious. Doña
Isabel was not the mother to look coldly on so gallant
a proposal; as for the daughter, then dreaming her
maiden days away in a convent at Seville, her own
consent to the betrothal was a question which gave
parents little concern in those days; the chief difficulty
was the splenetic father. Approaching the governor,
not without misgivings, Quevedo said: "Time
passes, Señor Pedrarias, and with time, all flesh.
Those who shall take our places follow close at our
heels. A powerful rival converted into a firm ally is
double compensation, and the father of four daughters
has not the opportunity every day to refuse a governor
for a son-in-law. Vasco Nuñez de Balboa, a man
of no mean parts, well-born and famous, asks your
daughter in marriage. Grant him his desire, and so
heal discord and fortify your declining years."
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding the obvious advantages, Pedrarias
hesitated. It was no easy matter at once to purify
the poisoned stream of thought. But the offer was
too tempting to be declined, although Pedrarias would
have much preferred for his adviser a Thrasybulus,
who counselled Periander to cut off the tallest heads
if he would maintain his power. The old man, still
hugging his suspicions, signed the marriage contract,
and ordered fair Doña María to appear and accept
marital honors. But even the gift of the daughter
was like the gifts of Medea—envenomed.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Now surely might Vasco Nuñez walk the firm earth,
his fortune ascendant. Adelantado, captain-general
of the Southern Sea, son-in-law of Pedrarias, and in
favor with the royal authorities, though Ferdinand,
poor king, was dead. The clouds which had so long
obscured Balboa's rising fame were by this masterly
invocation of the bishop forever dissipated. There
was no longer any fear from the unclean ghosts of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_440' href='#Page_440'>440</a></span>
entombed mistakes, while his good deeds would shine
with steadier and ever-increasing lustre. He might
now prosecute adventure to the uttermost of his
ambition, while his friend and counsellor, the bishop,
carried the happy tidings of reconciliation to court.<a id='FA_XII-2' href='#FN_XII-2' class='fnanchor'>[XII-2]</a>
</p>

<p>
The year 1516 was advancing toward its middle
term. Vasco Nuñez craved permission from his
father-in-law—for betrothal was equivalent to marriage
so far as the political aspect of the case was
concerned—to proceed to Acla and continue the
business there begun, which was indeed none other
than part of his original scheme. Pedrarias assented,
placing every requisite at the command of his dear
son. The South Sea expeditions had drained the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_441' href='#Page_441'>441</a></span>
colony of most of its available men, yet so esteemed
was Vasco Nuñez that all who were at Antigua
eagerly flocked to his standard. Fernando de Argüello,
a notary, formerly the opponent of Nicuesa,
but always a partisan of Vasco Nuñez, having accumulated
wealth placed it at the disposal of his friend,
and soon after Balboa embarked with eighty men.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">SOUTH SEA EXPEDITION.</div>

<p>
Arrived at Acla he found the post destroyed and
the comandante Olano, the successor of Gabriel de
Rojas, together with twelve soldiers, had been massacred
by the men of Careta, in retaliation for the
act of Hurtado which consigned one hundred of their
number to slavery. For this outrage the people of
the province were declared outlaws. Balboa immediately
organized a municipality, appointed an alcalde
and a regidor, laid out a new town, and began to
build. Each citizen, either in person or by slaves,
was required to plant sufficient for his sustenance.
Requiring more men, Balboa accompanied Espinosa
to Antigua, early in 1517, and returned with two
hundred recruits. The restoration of Acla was intended
only as preliminary to further South Sea
discoveries; but this accomplished, an obstacle interposed
itself, at first glance insurmountable. In order
to navigate the new ocean ships were necessary. The
short voyages hitherto undertaken in native canoes
had been perilous in the extreme. Herein lay the
difficulty. The cordillera here rises abruptly from
the northern side of the Isthmus, undulating gently
on the opposite side toward the Southern Sea. On the
northern slope grew trees suitable for ship-building;
on the southern side vegetation was more diminutive.
But of what avail were trees on the border of one
ocean, for the purposes of navigation on the other?
</p>

<p>
The true standard of greatness is in the application
of means to ends. The magnitude of the means has
no more to do with it than the results, which may
or may not prove successful. With a few hundred
Spaniards, and such savages as could be whipped
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_442' href='#Page_442'>442</a></span>
into the service, Vasco Nuñez dared conceive and
execute the project of building ships on one side
of a chain of mountains for use on the other side; to
navigate his vessels in pieces or sections, on the backs
of Indians, over hills and swamps, and that under a
sun so hot, in an atmosphere so poisoned, and through
vegetation so rank and tangled as successfully to have
defied the efforts of science for centuries thereafter.
"No living man in all the Indies," testifies the moderate
Herrera, "dared attempt such an enterprise,
or would have succeeded in it, save Vasco Nuñez de
Balboa."
</p>

<p>
The plan of Vasco Nuñez was to prepare his timber
as near as possible to some navigable point on one of
the many streams flowing into the South Sea, which
are generally torrents on the mountain-side, but which
become broad and calm before reaching the ocean.
The stream chosen for the purpose was called the Rio
de las Balsas,<a id='FA_XII-3' href='#FN_XII-3' class='fnanchor'>[XII-3]</a> or River of the Rafts. Carpenters
and builders are sent out in search of trees suitable
for the purpose, and the preparation of the timber
is begun. With fifty men Francisco Compañon
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_443' href='#Page_443'>443</a></span>
passes over the cordillera and selects a place upon the
river, twenty-two leagues from Acla, from which to
launch the ships. Likewise on the summit of the
sierra, twelve leagues from Acla, he builds a fort, to
serve as a half-way house for rest and protection,
beside stations established at other points. All is
bustle and activity at Acla and in the neighboring
forests; some are felling trees, some measuring and
hewing timber; some preparing anchors, rigging, and
stores. "In all labors," says Las Casas, "Vasco
Nuñez took the foremost part, working with his own
hands and giving aid and encouragement everywhere."
</p>

<div class="sidenote">CARRIES SHIPS ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS.</div>

<p>
Materials for four brigantines being at length prepared,
the herculean task of transportation across the
mountains is next to be performed. Thirty negroes
have been secured from Antigua, but these are not a
tenth part of the force required. Squads of soldiers
are therefore sent out in every direction, and natives
are driven in to the number of several thousand.
Upon their naked backs the heavy timbers are laid,
and goaded forward by merciless overseers, among
whom is the black African as well as the white
European, they are forced through the marshy thicket
and up the rocky steep until they sink exhausted
beneath their burden. Unused to labor, ill-fed, made
desperate by their distress, some attempt escape, but
the bloodhound is quickly on their track; some kill
themselves, but more sink lifeless under their heavy
loads. All along those terrible leagues the newly
cut path is strewed with dead savages, and soon the
air is rank from putrid carcasses. "More than five
hundred Indians perished in the transportation of
these ships," affirmed Bishop Quevedo before the
court of Spain, and Las Casas says the deaths were
nearer two thousand in number.<a id='FA_XII-4' href='#FN_XII-4' class='fnanchor'>[XII-4]</a> To take the places
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_444' href='#Page_444'>444</a></span>
of the dead, recruits are caught in the forest; the work
goes bravely on, and the stupendous feat is finally
accomplished. The wild bank of the Balsas was
strewed with materials for this new sea navigation.
But on putting the pieces together it is found that
after all the toil there is timber enough for only two
vessels instead of four; the rest has been lost by the
way. And this is not the worst of it. That which
has been brought over at such cruel cost, cut near the
coast and hewed green as it was, is so full of worms
that it cannot be used. All must be thrown away and
the work begun anew.<a id='FA_XII-5' href='#FN_XII-5' class='fnanchor'>[XII-5]</a>
</p>

<p>
Timber is sought nearer at hand this time, and
with fair success. Vasco Nuñez now divides his force
into three parties, and sends one to hew timber, one
to bring supplies from Acla, and a third to forage
on the natives. Again they are ready with new materials
to begin construction, when the heavens suddenly
darken and drop such a deluge on them that
they are obliged to take refuge in trees. Part of
the timber is swept away, and part buried in mud.
To add to their misfortunes, foraging fails; hunger
pinches; and "when Vasco Nuñez himself was forced
to feed on roots," says Las Casas, always with an eye
to his protégés, "it may well be imagined to what
extremity six hundred Indian captives were reduced."
</p>

<p>
It now looks very dark to Vasco Nuñez, and he
begins to consider if it were not better to move on,
one way or the other, than to die there. But these
misgivings are only for a moment. No, it is not better.
Throwing a bridge of floating withe-tied logs
across the river he sends over Compañon with a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_445' href='#Page_445'>445</a></span>
strong company, and tells him never to return except
with food. Hurtado he despatches to Antigua
for more men, and goes himself to Acla for necessary
effects. In all which he is successful; and he is
successful finally in floating two brigantines upon the
Balsas. There is no such thing as failure this side of
death.
</p>

<p>
What a bright vision it is that greets him as he drops
down into the sea, his own sea that he had found and
well-nigh lost again! Heaven is indeed beautiful if
it be anything fairer. Silver and gold and pearl are
the sunshine, land, and sky; while the sea, the murmuring,
gladdening, majestic sea; it would inspire a
brute with nobility, one sight of it!
</p>

<p>
Dreams and realities! Wild as had been the dreams
of these ignorant and voracious men, dreams with
their Indies and Araby isles, they fell far short of
reality. How could they dream of a Montezuma
empire waiting expectantly to welcome the destroyer,
or of an Inca faction so evenly balanced that so light a
hell-flake as a Pizarro might turn it?
</p>

<div class="sidenote">AT THE PEARL ISLANDS.</div>

<p>
Selecting Isla Rica, the largest of the Pearl Islands,
as a rendezvous and place of settlement, Balboa discharged
his vessels there and sent them back to bring
from the Balsas the remainder of the company, together
with materials for two more ships, which were
in due time completed, making four in all. More
supplies were brought from Acla, and journeys between
the two seas were from this time frequent.
Meanwhile, after pacifying the Pearl Islands, he embarked
with one hundred men for a cruise eastward.
After sailing twenty leagues a shoal of whales so
frightened the sailors that they anchored for the night
near the shore, and embraced the opportunity to kill
a village of Indians for having put to death Bernardo
Morales and his men in a former expedition. The wind
being contrary the fleet next morning returned to the
Pearl Islands.
</p>

<p>
Thus haply launched upon the tide of glorious adventure,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_446' href='#Page_446'>446</a></span>
with full freedom in the south, and in harmony
with superior powers, what could fortune offer more
satisfactory or secure? But fickle the goddess, and
malignant the while, keeping alive suspicion and envy
where only honor and good-will should be. It happened
about this time that as one of Balboa's captains
was setting out on his return to the South Sea, rumor
reached Acla that Lope de Sosa, a native of Córdova,
then acting governor of the Canary Islands, had been
appointed to supersede Pedrarias. At one time such
a prospect would have been hailed with delight by
Vasco Nuñez, but now that his fortunes were so happily
linked with those of his ancient enemy he could
desire no change.
</p>

<p>
One evening while in friendly conversation with the
vicar, Rodrigo Perez, and the notary, Valderrábano—for
on these Pearl Islands now were all the paraphernalia
of spiritual and temporal rulership—upon the
probable effect of a change of governors on South Sea
affairs Vasco Nuñez remarked, "It may be possible
that Lope de Sosa has ere this received his commission,
and that even now he is at Antigua, in which
case my lord Pedrarias is no longer governor, and
all our toilsome undertakings will profit us nothing.
In order therefore to know best how to proceed in
this emergency I am of opinion that it would be
well to send some faithful messenger to Acla for our
further necessities; and if the new governor has come,
we will furnish our ships, and pursue our enterprise as
best we can, trusting to his future approval. But if
my lord Pedrarias is still in power, he will allay our
fears, and we will then set out upon our voyage, which
I trust in God will succeed according to our wishes."
I beg the reader to remember these words, and say if
in them is hidden the venom of treason to the father-governor
when morbid acrimony decides them criminal.
I do not say that at this juncture Vasco Nuñez would
not have disregarded any whimsical malevolence on
the part of his future father-in-law which might stand
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_447' href='#Page_447'>447</a></span>
in the way of his high purposes. I think he would
have done so. But that he saw no necessity for so
doing, and never dreamed of disobedience or disloyalty,
I am very sure.
</p>

<p>
As his ill-fate would have it, just when Vasco Nuñez
was concluding his remarks on this subject, a sentinel
on guard in front of the general's quarters stepped up
under the awning to shelter himself from a passing
shower. This fellow, whose sense of smell was so acute
that he could detect disloyalty though hidden in a
barrel of salt, found here at once a mare's nest. Of
course his general was talking treason; he had often
been suspected, and now he openly admitted that if
affairs planned in Spain or at Antigua did not suit him,
he would sail away and leave all emperors and governors
in the lurch. And if he alone might have the
disclosing of this villainy his fortune was made.

A story is told of one Micer Codro, a Venetian
astrologer, who followed his stars to the Indies and
there interpreted nature for a consideration. For up
and down the world the devil used to lead him with the
faintest thread of comet-light. While at the height
of his power in Darien, the horoscope of Vasco Nuñez
was cast by this philosopher, and his fate foretold with
all the precision characterizing the profession. Directing
the attention of his auditor to a particular star he
said: "When you behold that star at yonder point,
know that your fate approaches; your fortune then
will be in jeopardy, and your life in peril. But if you
escape that danger, wealth and renown such as have
fallen to the lot of no captain in all the Indies will be
yours." Amidst the bustling activities of life Vasco
Nuñez had well-nigh forgotten the words of the soothsayer.
But while waiting the progress of his plans
at the Pearl Islands, he chanced to take a stroll upon
the beach one night in company with his friends.
The air was clear of moisture, and the heavens ablaze
with stars which seemed by their own light multiplied.
Nor was this gorgeous firmament more glorious than
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_448' href='#Page_448'>448</a></span>
the hopes which then thrilled the breast of the cavalier.
While in careless conversation his eye was
suddenly arrested by the star of his destiny which
hung portentous in the exact spot designated by
Micer Codro. The prediction of the astrologer at once
flashed upon him. "But surely," he thought, "the
worthy fellow read carelessly, or else possesses little
knowledge of his art, for my time of peril has passed.
I will, however, accept the saving clause of his prediction,
and now achieve the fame and wealth whereof
he spake." Then with a smile he turned to his companions.
"Have a care of soothsayers," he said gayly.
"You all know Micer Codro. According to his prediction
I stand this moment on the verge of demolition.
But I defy thee, fate! See there those ships,
and this wealth-bordered sea; see here this good
right arm, this stout heart, and you, my friends, three
hundred faithful men. Does this look like collapse?"
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding the rumor of a new governor at
Antigua, this South Sea enterprise ought to be prosecuted
at all hazard. By authority both of the king
and of his representative in Darien the expedition had
been undertaken. Money had been spent and infinite
toil; life had been adventured—the lives of Spaniards,
that is to say, for a thousand or two dead savages were
scarcely to be regarded in the account. And now it
behooved them to give no new king or new governor
the opportunity of ruining their hopes by countermanding
the expedition.
</p>

<p>
It was finally arranged that Andrés Garabito,
Luis Botello, Andrés de Valderrábano, and Fernando
Muñoz should proceed to Acla, and as they drew near
the town the party should halt; one of them should
enter at night alone, and, proceeding to the house of
Vasco Nuñez, should ascertain from the servant to be
found there if Pedrarias was superseded; and if the
new governor had arrived the party would withdraw
unobserved, return to the South Sea, and proclaim
Vasco Nuñez governor of Tierra Firme, at the same
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_449' href='#Page_449'>449</a></span>
time giving him a paper purporting to be his commission.
Thus would his command be deceived into
the belief that he was legal ruler, and so follow his
bidding without question. This was a glance toward
treason; it was as bad as treason; but neither now nor
ever was it treason. The projected stratagem was
dangerous, and wholly useless, and most unfortunate,
as the result proved; complicating affairs and aiding
his enemies in casting over him that cloud of suspicion
which ultimately involved him in ruin.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">TREACHEROUS MESSENGERS.</div>

<p>
Likewise the agents for this errand were unhappily
chosen. Garabito was the deadly enemy of Balboa,
though the latter did not know it. Worse than that,
far more dastardly and damnable than enemy, he
was a treacherous friend. Balboa had often shown
him favors, and placed implicit confidence in him, as
the prominence given him in this delicate mission
plainly indicated. Within a friendly, even fawning
exterior, lurked deadly hate. It originated thus:
While Vasco Nuñez was yet under the cloud of the
governor's displeasure, Garabito had attempted improper
intimacy with Careta's daughter, Balboa's
wife after the Indian fashion. One word from her
protector, one glance from his eye—for the miscreant
saw perdition in it—was sufficient to check his presumption;
but Garabito never forgot it, and awaited
only his revenge. While on the Balsas he had even
written Pedrarias that it was Balboa's purpose, on
reaching the ocean, to throw off allegiance to him, and
to every one but the king. He further affirmed that
Vasco Nuñez cared nothing for his daughter, loved
only the Indian girl, and never intended to ratify
his betrothal obligation. Though Garabito knew well
enough he deserved hanging for this, and might even
achieve that infamy, yet he understood both himself
and Pedrarias, and he knew these lies would fatten on
the old man's soul.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">GARABITO'S INFAMY.</div>

<p>
When Garabito arrived at Acla, instead of doing
as he had been told, he set about to perform a little
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_450' href='#Page_450'>450</a></span>
drama which should at once precipitate revenge and
free him from the odium of traitorous friendship.
Mingling with the gossips of the town, he talked mysteriously
about South Sea affairs, threw out insinuations,
and dropped dark hints concerning Vasco Nuñez
and the government. By such means he succeeded
in causing himself to be arrested; and when brought
before the magistrate for examination, no torture was
required to draw from him all he knew, and more.
An abstract of the evidence taken in this investigation,
together with the letters and papers of Garabito,
was forwarded to Pedrarias.
</p>

<p class="p2">
When Vasco Nuñez embarked from Antigua on
this enterprise, it was stipulated that he should return
at the expiration of eighteen months. The time
having expired, he wrote Pedrarias requesting its
extension, giving as a reason for requiring it the extraordinary
difficulties under which he had labored,
and the attendant delays. He requested Fernando de
Argüello, who had a large pecuniary interest at stake,
to gain further time, if possible, as otherwise their
expenditure and toil would all be lost. In answer to
the application of Argüello, Pedrarias said little; but
within the caldron the black stuff simmered.
</p>

<p>
This inopportune revival of the ancient feud between
the governors excited no small stir at Antigua.
And when tidings of Garabito's arrest were received,
and the character of his testimony was made known,
the friends of Vasco Nuñez entertained fears for his
safety. It made little difference whether what this
villain had said was true or false—though no one believed
that Vasco Nuñez contemplated anything criminal—old
man Pedrarias with his malignity aroused
was a fiend incarnate. Argüello wrote Balboa that the
governor would neither grant nor deny an extension
of time, and the notary advised him to put to sea at
once, and place himself beyond the rancorous caprice
of Pedrarias. He further informed him that in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_451' href='#Page_451'>451</a></span>
event of a rupture he could appeal to the Jeronimite
Fathers, at Santo Domingo, who would see justice
done him. Unfortunately, this letter was intercepted
and sent to Pedrarias.
</p>

<p class="p2">
The conflagration which sweeps a city is often kindled
by a spark. The South Sea discoverer entertained
a harmless ruse, justifiable, in his opinion, as tending
to settle the minds of his men and ensure their more
perfect obedience in hazardous enterprise; he harbored
at the most the intention of placing himself for
no unlawful purpose beyond the call of the new governor
until he had consummated his long cherished
schemes, and not of deceiving the old governor, to
whom, if still in power, his messengers were to disclose
all his fears, in the belief that his necessities
would certainly be relieved. These trivial thoughts,
flung distorted by Garabito into the inflammable breast
of Pedrarias, were more than sufficient to light a flame
beyond the power of man to extinguish. On former
occasions the enmity had been rather of a political than
a personal nature; now it enters the private chambers
of the affections, and beside crimes plotted against the
ruler, the father is to be wounded and insulted. And
his hate becomes unto death, murderous.
</p>

<p>
With the several pretended disclosures of Garabito
before him, his mind ran quickly back over the career
of Vasco Nuñez, his ill treatment of Enciso, his expulsion
of Nicuesa, his irregularities while in office,
the king's order to call him to a reckoning, the brilliant
discoveries intervening, the failure to convict
him of crimes, the king's favor, and at last the nearer
and to be hoped final reconciliation. Warmer yet
within him glowed the thought of these things, as
his mind dwelt upon the letters disparaging to himself
which Vasco Nuñez had sent the king, and
recalled once more what Garabito had said concerning
the repudiation of both himself and his daughter.
He talked with Bachiller Corral, who had been
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_452' href='#Page_452'>452</a></span>
once arrested by Vasco Nuñez for improper conduct,
and to the royal treasurer, Alonso de la Puente,
whom Vasco Nuñez had once offended by demanding
the payment of a debt, he read the letter of Fernando
de Argüello, and then ordered the arrest of the
writer.
</p>

<p>
He communed with his heart in his rage and was
glad. And he wrote his son-in-law a letter, his dear
son-in-law, a friendly, fatherly letter, requesting his
presence at Acla for the purpose of consultation over
affairs affecting their mutual interests. This letter
was despatched by messengers urged to the greatest
haste, that the friends of Vasco Nuñez might not have
time to warn him of his danger. "Once within my
grasp," muttered the old man, "he never shall escape
me." That he might not embark on some lengthy
voyage or otherwise delay his coming, Pedrarias
ordered Francisco Pizarro to place himself at the
head of as large a force as he could muster, and immediately
to find and arrest his former comrade and
commander, Vasco Nuñez de Balboa, and bring him
under safe guard to Acla.
</p>

<p>
Now the dissembling letter of Pedrarias, so the
chroniclers tell us, was placed in the hands of Vasco
Nuñez while yet the star of his destiny hovered, impatient
of flight, about the spot whereon it was to determine
his fate; which proves to any reasonable mind,
beyond peradventure, several things;
<i>item</i>, that the
heavenly lights are fingered by Omnipotence for individual
import;
<i>item</i>, that Micer Codro knows the stars;
<i>item</i>, that the stars know Micer Codro;
<i>item, parva
momenta in spem metumque impellere animos</i>.
</p>

<p>
Conscious of no wrong, Vasco Nuñez suspected no
treachery, and on receipt of the letter he set out at
once with the returning messengers to grant his father-in-law
the desired interview, leaving his command at
the Pearl Islands in charge of Francisco Compañon.
As they journeyed toward Acla he interrogated his
companions concerning the affairs of the colony. At
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_453' href='#Page_453'>453</a></span>
first they were cautious in their replies, and made
evasive answers; but the prompt and cordial manner
in which Vasco Nuñez responded to the summons of
Pedrarias carried conviction of his integrity. Further
than this, they had long known Vasco Nuñez as a
gallant cavalier and a genial friend, and they resolved,
come what might, he should not fall into the clutches
of his enemy without a word of warning from them.
Enjoining secrecy, they told him all; that current
opinion considered not only his liberty but that his life
was in jeopardy.
</p>

<p>
Balboa would not believe it. Pedrarias might be
very angry, though he had written in so friendly a
strain; it was his nature to be suspicious and treacherous;
he could not help it; he was martyr to a hate
wherein he was created, and not unlike that of Acrisius
who quarrelled with his twin brother Proetus before
they were born. There might be some difficulty
in pacifying Pedrarias, but as for fearing him, the idea
was preposterous. Even though he had meditated
treason against the governor, which he had not, he
was not guilty of any criminal act; and surely a man
cannot be hanged for his meditations. Of course he
would go forward.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ARREST.</div>

<p>
As he descended the mountains and drew near Acla,
Vasco Nuñez was met by the force sent out by the
governor. As the leader advanced to make the arrest,
his old friend and patron cast on him a reproachful
look and exclaimed, "How is this, Francisco Pizarro?
You were not wont to come out in this manner to
receive me!" He offered no opposition, however, and
made no remonstrance when the irons were put upon
him and he was led away to prison at Acla.
</p>

<p class="p2">
History presents few sadder pictures than the closing
scenes in the career of Vasco Nuñez de Balboa.
And as we look at it, our sorrow waxes hot with indignation
over the triumph of wrong. Occasionally,
in the hostile encounters of men, justice seems to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_454' href='#Page_454'>454</a></span>
abandon the arena, leaving iniquity master of the
field; at which times the spectator burns for the
power which Omnipotence declines to exercise.
</p>

<p>
The game here played was for a valuable life. On
one side was a singularly morbid hate, envenomed
and pitiless, united with unscrupulous treachery and
hypocrisy, which in an old man of ability, breeding,
and position, was hideous beyond expression. On the
other side were recognized talents of so exceptional
an order as to make the possessor the most popular
man in the colony. This is what kept his irascible adversary
on nettles. Vasco Nuñez was the hero of this
conquest. He was to Pedrarias as Loki to Baldur,
or as Hyperion to a satyr; and in their strangely
assorted friendship they were more unequally yoked
than in their enmity they were divided. He was
the mirror in which by comparison the governor
most clearly saw his own infirmities. Like Othello
he was of that free and open nature which thinks
men honest that but seem so. His faults were those
of the times rather than of the man. He was as ambitious
as Achilles, but it was a laudable ambition as
times went. He was neither voracious nor avaricious;
cruel he unquestionably was, but not wantonly so; he
gathered gold, but he scattered it open-handedly. He
coveted fame; and in those days neither equity nor
humanity were essential to greatness. I do not regard
him as greedy of office; he loved power, but he
loved adventure more. Of course, in principle, the
robber life he led was wrong, though sanctioned by
philosophers and divines, and Vasco Nuñez aspired
to belong to neither class. He was an illiterate cavalier,
honest and religious, ready to accept the theories
of the day if they did not too greatly interfere with
his desires. Neither his loyalty nor his religion was
sufficient to be of great injury to him; although,
if we may credit Peter Martyr, he never attempted
any adventure without the invocation of the deity
and all the saints. Among his comrades he had ever
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_455' href='#Page_455'>455</a></span>
at command a light artillery of wit; in logical argument
he was not equal to his archenemy, but in action
he was the inferior of no man. A natural and perfect
leader, he was out of place as second. Conception
and execution were one with him; he could not be
bound by another's ideas. Latent in him were inexhaustible
resources, known to exist, even by himself,
only as occasion required them. Only with emotions
of pride might any Spaniard regard his frank
intrepidity, chivalrous bearing, and affable, generous
disposition. In cruelty, subtlety, and base cunning
Pedrarias was his superior, but not in war, or
statesmanship, not to mention honorable enterprise.
Throughout his entire career, whatever Vasco Nuñez
touched by himself was a success; there was no chance
about it, but simply energy and ability, temperate
courage and common sense. His final overthrow was
accomplished not by fair and open opposition, but by
means most foul and damnable. Some might say that
in this contemplated assumption of authority he was,
like Icarus, flying too near the sun; yet, in truth, it
was no sun, but fires infernal that melted the wax of
his wings. His trial, to which let us now pass, was a
judicial assassination.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">HYPOCRISY AND CUNNING.</div>

<p class="p2">
Old man Pedrarias could scarcely conceal his exultation
in thus having, as he imagined, outwitted his
prisoner. He could with difficulty refrain from feasting
his eyes upon him; nay, he would not, and arraying
his features in fatherly concern, he repaired to
the prison. Gently he accosted Balboa, assuring him
that he had been forced to this step against his will,
that the treasurer, Puente, was the accuser, and that
he, the governor, was in duty bound to investigate
all charges, particularly accusations made by a royal
officer. "But be not cast down, my son," said the
venerable hypocrite, "neither give way to fear; for
the more clearly your actions are brought to light, the
brighter will shine your eminent and loyal services."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_456' href='#Page_456'>456</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Going his way, Pedrarias threw himself with all
his strength into the prosecution, or rather, I should
say, persecution. The laws of Spain, transported to
the colonies and administered by passionate and unprincipled
men, were capable of almost any construction
desired, and hence were as often used to cloak
villainy as to punish crime. The law was ever on the
side of him who possessed the power to enforce it.
All the accusations of former trials were in this instance
brought together, and old charges, long since
obliterated by royal forgiveness, were renewed. To
the oft-told tales of Enciso's imprisonment and Nicuesa's
death, were added misdeeds conjectured or
invented by the listening sentinel, Garabito, and the
rest. Arguello's letter was offered in evidence, and
all his enemies had their fling at him. The licentiate,
Espinosa, before whom the case was brought, was
now a firm adherent of the governor. He had been
paid his price in the South Sea command, and the
downfall of Balboa would open for him further empire
in that quarter.
</p>

<p>
All is going well; Pedrarias is content. The prisoner's
chains are doubled. A little torture now
applied might be pleasing in effect. Dropping the
mask, Pedrarias enters the prison. "So, villain! you
thought to escape me," he cried. "Your governor
has become your tool, your plaything; his daughter
an idle jest, jilted for a savage strumpet. Thank
God! your days are numbered."
</p>

<p>
Balboa at first made no reply, did not even manifest
surprise. He had seen, soon after the trial began,
that his judges thirsted for his blood, and that he was
foredoomed. Finally he spake. "I am here at your
bidding. Since last we pledged friendship I have
toiled faithfully in your behalf, and mine. I have
suffered many hardships, and have overcome obstacles
deemed insurmountable by most men. Never for a
moment have I entertained one thought disloyal to
my betrothed or you. For the truth of this I refer
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_457' href='#Page_457'>457</a></span>
you to my actions, and call God to witness. If I am
guilty, as you say, why am I here? Think you, with
four good ships and three hundred devoted men at
my command, with fortune beckoning me from every
direction, that had I harbored treason I would not
have spread my sails and sought a land unknown,
beyond all fear of capture? You know, my lord Pedrarias,
that I am innocent."
</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SENTENCE.</div>

<p>
It was patent to all that Vasco Nuñez was to be
sacrificed to the insatiable hate of the hoary-headed
governor. Even Espinosa was becoming tired of it,
and would have discharged the accused, had it not
been for Pedrarias and Puente, who insisted on what
they called a verdict in accordance with the law and
evidence. Under such pressure Espinosa was forced to
adjudge the prisoner guilty. The penalty was death.
Vasco Nuñez claimed the right of appeal to the
Council of the Indies, which was denied him; to the
Jeronimite Fathers, which was also denied. Espinosa
became alarmed; he shrank from having on his soul
the blood of this man, so gallant a cavalier, so eminent
a discoverer; he never really desired more than to
drive him into obscurity, and he begged the governor
that the petition for appeal might be granted. "No,"
said Pedrarias, "if he has sinned, let him suffer."
</p>

<p>
With horror the colonists heard that Vasco Nuñez
was condemned to be beheaded. Four of his friends
were to suffer with him, Andrés de Valderrábano,
Luis Botello, Fernando Muñoz, and Fernando de
Argüello.
</p>

<p class="p2">
It was a dismal day at Acla, the chroniclers tell us,
that on which five brave men were doomed to die, not
for any crime, but as victims of a ferocious, savage-hearted
old man. At an early hour the dull strokes
of the carpenter's hammer were heard in the plaza
where the scaffold rose. Troops of men gathered on
the streets and talked of the coming execution, wondering
if there would be an attempt at rescue. But
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_458' href='#Page_458'>458</a></span>
Pedrarias had taken care of that. Were the heavenly
powers a-dreaming that they should without
interference permit this horrible crime? Alas! these
very men had just as iniquitously slain their innocent
thousands. Why should we pity them? And the
same oft-invoked Omnipotence had permitted the
ghastly work to be done in his name. Of what avail
is it to wonder?
</p>

<p>
Heavily chained, and surrounded by a strong guard,
the men were brought forth. First came Vasco Nuñez.
His step and bearing were not those of a malefactor.
Fire flashed from his eye and indignation flushed
his cheek as he beheld the preparations for his ignominy.
But this renowned and honored chieftain, even
while marching to the scaffold, was less to be pitied
than Pedrarias, who from behind a screened window
was this moment feasting his eyes upon the victim.
Before the prisoner walked the town-crier, who, as
he approached the middle of the square, exclaimed
in a loud voice, "Behold the usurper, a man recreant
to his trust, and disloyal to his king. Let death be
ever the doom of traitors." "'Tis false!" cried Vasco
Nuñez. "Never have I been disloyal or untrue. To
infamous treachery and wrong I yield my life, and not
to justice."<a id='FA_XII-6' href='#FN_XII-6' class='fnanchor'>[XII-6]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_459' href='#Page_459'>459</a></span>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE EXECUTION.</div>

<p>
The sacrament having been previously administered,
and having made confession, Vasco Nuñez, with
his usual firm step and calm demeanor, mounted the
scaffold. Raising his eyes to heaven he called on
God to witness his innocence. Then with a rapid
farewell glance at heaven's light and earth's beauty,
at the eager upturned faces of his friends, he placed
his head upon the block, and in a moment more it was
rolling trunkless on the platform!
</p>

<p>
Valderrábano, Botello, and Muñoz each suffered in
turn. Argüello remained. A last attempt was made
to move Pedrarias. "It cannot be," was the reply.
"Rather than one of them should live, I myself will
die." It was dark before the last dull heavy stroke
told the crowd that the sickening work was done.
With the death of the offender justice is satisfied; not
so vengeance. By order of Pedrarias the head of
Vasco Nuñez was placed upon a pole, and displayed
in the market-place.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Time, which throws a misty cloud between the
present and the past, and strips the hideousness from
many iniquitous deeds, drops no friendly mantle over
the horrors of that day at Acla. One century after
another rolls by, and the colors on the canvas deepen;
the red gore dripping from the scaffold becomes redder,
the black heart of Pedrarias blacker, and the
generous qualities and brilliant achievements of Vasco
Nuñez shine yet brighter.

<p>
For the villainous adjudging of Vasco Nuñez,
Gaspar de Espinosa received his place on the South
Sea. And when true tidings reached Pedrarias of
the appointment of Lope de Sosa as his successor,
the grizzly old governor did exactly that for which
he pretended to have beheaded Vasco Nuñez. Striking
corollaries from the historical propositions of the
preceding chapter.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CONDUCT OF PEDRARIAS CONDEMNED.</div>

<p>
That Pedrarias was not at once deposed may seem
strange to us. He was deposed, however; but slipping
south he sought new fields, as we shall presently
see; and by the intercession of powerful friends at
court he managed to retain rulership for a term of
years. Then, too, the changes. It was troublesome
and expensive for royalty to establish subordinate
governments in the Indies; and as nearly all of
Spain's New World governors, and, indeed, officials
and subjects, were wrong in some particular, there
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_461' href='#Page_461'>461</a></span>
was not always encouragement to make a change.
Yet Spain and all Christendom were indignant over
the infamous doings at Acla. The friars of St Jerome
instantly clipped the wings of the cormorant, by
ordering him in the kings name "to resolve upon
nothing by himself, but to follow the advice of the
<i>cabildo</i><a id='FA_XIII-1' href='#FN_XIII-1' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-1]</a> of Darien; and, moreover, to send to Española
all the gold taken from Cacique Paris." This was of
little practical avail, however. Royalty might issue
edicts; but those appointed to enforce them seemed
to turn to corruption on entering the atmosphere of
the Indies.
</p>

<p>
Some said, if the good bishop had been there, Vasco
Nuñez had not died. But according to Micer Codro
it was scarcely among the possibilities for the inauspicious
friend of Balboa to have been present at the
right moment. Associated with the alcalde mayor
and the governor in magisterial authority, the bishop
could without doubt have diverted the quarrel from
such gory channels; for there was always enough of
the temporal in his spiritual polities to give his influence
weight in balancing power. It was a wolfish
flock. The bishop complained of it to the king; and
on the other hand the royal officers complained of
the bishop. Both were right. It was impossible too
severely to censure such acts as were constantly perpetrated
by the officials of Castilla del Oro, and
although Quevedo had gone to Spain on the more
pleasing errand of love and reconciliation, he found it
convenient occasionally to say a word to the king in
his own defense, and not without influence on the imperial
ear. Once the royal officials wrote the king that
the bishop neglected the conversion of the Indians,
favored Vasco Nuñez against the government, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_462' href='#Page_462'>462</a></span>
discouraged colonization by speaking ill of the country;
and again that the bishop was a source of constant
disturbance, and praying that a <i>provisor</i>, talented
and upright, be appointed to superintend sacred affairs.<a id='FA_XIII-2' href='#FN_XIII-2' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-2]</a>
</p>

<p>
Before the sovereign, Quevedo spoke disparagingly
of both Pedrarias and Vasco Nuñez; the prelate
alone was perfect. But beside the genuine ring of
Las Casas, the base metal of Quevedo's composition
sounded flat. The protector-general was at this time
busy at once with his colonization scheme and his
impeachment of the Jeronimite Fathers, who, although
meaning well, were slack in exacting the right as
measured by apostolic zeal.
</p>

<p>
On one occasion, in the royal antechamber at Molin
del Rey, while waiting for the bishop of Badajoz,
one of the king's preachers, with whom he had an
engagement to dine, Quevedo was bluntly accosted
by Las Casas. "I understand, my lord, that you are
the bishop of Darien. I too am interested in the Indies,
and it is my duty to offer you fellowship." "Ah!
Señor Casas," rudely replied Quevedo. "And from
what text will you preach us a sermon to-day?" "I
have ready two sermons," retorted the always armed
Protector, "which, if you would listen to them, might
prove to you of higher import than all the moneys
which you bring from the Indies." "You are beside
yourself! You are beside yourself!" was all the bishop
could stammer as his host appeared and withdrew him
from the merciless shots of Las Casas. But Quevedo
was not to escape so easily. Presenting himself after
dinner at the house of the king's preacher, Las Casas
tortured his enemy into yet hotter dispute. Young
Charles hearing of it ordered the battle of the priests
to be continued before him. This was the first audience
by the prince in matters relative to the Indies.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_463' href='#Page_463'>463</a></span>
Brought into the royal presence Quevedo thanked
God for the honor, pronounced the first governor of
Darien a bad one, the second much worse, and the
savages in a deplorable condition. Las Casas following
charged the fault as much to royal officers and
clergy as to hidalgos and lesser subjects.
</p>

<p>
Soon after this discussion Quevedo presented two
memorials, one against Pedrarias Dávila, and the other
for restricting the power of governors in general, and
of the military, and for the better protection of the natives.
He pledged himself to name a ruler for Castilla
del Oro, meaning Diego Velazquez, then governor of
Cuba, who would expend from his own private means
fifteen thousand ducats in the service of the colony.
Within a few days thereafter Quevedo was seized with
an illness which terminated in his death; Charles
was summoned to accept the imperial crown, and for
a time little attention was paid to the affairs of the
Indies.<a id='FA_XIII-3' href='#FN_XIII-3' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-3]</a>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">QUEVEDO AND OVIEDO IN SPAIN.</div>

<p>
Another political agency appeared in Spain about
this time. Gonzalo Fernandez de Oviedo y Valdés,
first chronicler of the New World, who, as we have
seen, came with Pedrarias to Tierra Firme as superintendent
of gold-melting and acting notary-general,
becoming disgusted with both the governor and the
bishop departed from that shore in October, 1515.
Scarcely had Oviedo arrived at Madrid when he
received word of King Ferdinand's death, which was
a severe blow, as he had hoped through the influence
of his former patrons to reorganize the government
of Castilla del Oro and place it on a better basis.
Proceeding to Flanders he laid the matter before the
ministers, and was referred to Cardinal Jimenez, who
listened and did nothing. There the matter rested
until the death of the cardinal, when Oviedo again
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_464' href='#Page_464'>464</a></span>
appeared at court and succeeded in obtaining the
appointment of Lope de Sosa to succeed Pedrarias
in the government of Castilla del Oro. Satisfied
thus far in his attempts to benefit the colonists at
Antigua, he solicited for himself the government of
Santa Marta. The appointment was conferred; but
being refused one hundred knights of Santiago, who
were deemed indispensable to the subjugation of the
country, he declined the office. Like Quevedo, he
aroused the enmity of Las Casas, through his opposition
to the schemes of the fiery philanthropist in
the management of the natives. Nevertheless Oviedo
obtained many beneficial decrees for Darien. The
duties of the governor were defined anew; royal officials
were forbidden to trade; the royal assayer was
required to give bonds; orders were issued regulating
the gold-melting house; duties were abolished for
four years; the export duty on gold was reduced
nearly one half for a term of five years.
</p>

<p class="p2">
A business paralysis succeeded the dark days at
Acla. Little was done in 1518 in the way of new adventure,
though Pedrarias had enough to occupy himself
withal, in keeping his own head on his shoulders.
More than one lofty scheme was cut short by the
stroke that laid lifeless Vasco Nuñez. The young
and hardy scarcely dared achieve prominence; the old
and imbecile could not; even the ferocious genius of
Francisco Pizarro lay dormant all through his fiery
youth, and past early impatient manhood, unknown
even to himself.
</p>

<p>
Made captain-general of the South Sea, not long
after the catastrophe at Acla, Espinosa was unable at
once to take command in person of the force at Isla
Rica. Though the licentiate was of a mild, obedient
disposition, it was not without misgivings that Pedrarias
permitted him to assume so important a trust, the
most dangerous for purposes of revolt of any within
the government of Castilla del Oro; for instruments
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_465' href='#Page_465'>465</a></span>
employed in the accomplishment of base purposes are
not apt to inspire the greatest confidence. But Espinosa
was not a mere rover; he was an anchored judge
already high in colonial office, whose robberies and
murders, however unjust and lawless, were of a quasi
judicial nature; moreover he was popular with the
soldiers, for his legal decisions by no means interfered
with popular rights in pillage and licentiousness. Indeed,
when Pedrarias afterward contemplated absence,
the people of Antigua begged that Espinosa might be
left there to govern them, but this excited the jealousy
of the governor, who refused the petition.<a id='FA_XIII-4' href='#FN_XIII-4' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-4]</a>
</p>

<p>
The much talked of interoceanic chain of posts, with
a commercial city at either end, was not yet an accomplished
fact. As the breadth, coast-trends, and configuration
of the country became better known, Acla
was found situated too far to the eastward. The narrowest
part of the Isthmus had been ascertained, as
also the most practicable route for a road, requiring
a north-coast seaport somewhere opposite Panamá,
which had long since been decided upon as the best
site for a city on the southern seaboard. Hernan
Ponce de Leon, temporarily stationed there, had
abandoned the place, so that both termini of the
proposed road must be founded anew. The point
selected on the north coast was Nombre de Dios.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">SOUTH SEA ATTRACTIONS.</div>

<p>
Before Espinosa was ready for his South Sea command,
positive information of the appointment of Lope
de Sosa reached Antigua. It now behooved both
Pedrarias and the licentiate to look to their footing,
for it was not unlikely to fare hard with them in
their coming residencias. It might be as well, after
all, for these astute and subtle minds to fall back
upon the idea of Vasco Nuñez—indeed, the cavalier's
ideas seemed better than any of their own—of withdrawing
beyond the possibly too restraining influences
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_466' href='#Page_466'>466</a></span>
of superior authority, and establishing themselves in
freer latitudes. The north coast offered no further
attractions in any event. Give them the South Sea,
and Sosa might have the north, and die there at
his convenience. For it was assuredly the abode of
death.
</p>

<p>
Pedrarias accordingly determined to make the
southern seaboard his future base of operations, and
to convey thither as much as possible of what he
esteemed valuable. To this end he embarked from
Acla, and laid before the council at Antigua a proposal
to abandon that site, and remove the capital
to Panamá. The plan was not regarded with favor,
as he neither expected nor desired it to be; for, if
Panamá was made the capital, Sosa's government
would be there, and might seriously interfere with
his projects. Two advantages were, however, gained
by making the proposal. By opening the question
it unsettled the minds of residents at Antigua, and
enabled Pedrarias with less difficulty to enlist recruits,
and it could not afterward be said that he had sought
to abandon the government, having offered to carry
it with him. Nevertheless, he could not part with
the people and their council without a fling at them;
so, one night he summoned the cabildo to appear at
his house, and took from them their insignia of office,
leaving the municipality to manage as best it might
during his absence. Returning to Acla, he ordered
Espinosa to summon the forces stationed in the
province of Pocorosa, and unite with them all the
available troops of the colony. With these, and such
provisions and articles of trade and use as they could
lay their hands upon, the governor and the alcalde
mayor set out across the cordillera for the Southern
Sea.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">FOUNDING OF PANAMÁ.</div>

<p>
Pedrarias was not altogether satisfied with the
site of his proposed Pacific city. On either side of
the old fish-drying station thick tangled woods rose
from marshy bottoms; so that, while the spot called
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_467' href='#Page_467'>467</a></span>
Panamá was obviously malarious, there seemed at
hand no better one.<a id='FA_XIII-5' href='#FN_XIII-5' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-5]</a> At the Pearl Islands affairs
were found as Vasco Nuñez had left them. Compañon
had proved faithful to his trust. More acts of
possession were now inflicted on this thrice-gulped
wilderness, one on the mainland, January 27, 1519,
and one two days after, on the Isla Rica of Vasco
Nuñez, called by Pedrarias as Morales had christened
it, Isla de las Flores.<a id='FA_XIII-6' href='#FN_XIII-6' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-6]</a> Taking the ships Balboa had
built, the governor and Espinosa embarked the forces,
and proceeded to the island of Taboga,<a id='FA_XIII-7' href='#FN_XIII-7' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-7]</a> where Badajoz
had been three years before, opposite and some five
leagues distant from the proposed settlement.
</p>

<p>
Pedrarias and Espinosa had now at their command
about four hundred men, most of whom were opposed
to city-building as detrimental to the nobler profession
of plundering. But calming their fears in this regard,
Pedrarias sought to secure their interest in his scheme
by partitioning the lands adjacent to Panamá, and
giving to each man a section. Foraging expeditions
were sent out at once, and the soldiers were encouraged
to make captures, and so secure laborers for their
lands and means for the indulgence of their lusts. Thus
every settler soon had from forty to ninety slaves, who
did not live long, however. Nor were the colonists at
Antigua forgotten in this division, to the end that by
offering superior inducements here, the northern coast
might the sooner be depopulated.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_468' href='#Page_468'>468</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The formal act of founding the city of Panamá was
consummated August 15, 1519; the public notary certifying
that Pedrarias Dávila founded then and there a
city, the name whereof was Panamá, and that in the
name of God, and of the queen, Doña Juana, and
of Don Cárlos, her son, he would defend the same
against all opposers.<a id='FA_XIII-8' href='#FN_XIII-8' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-8]</a>
</p>

<p class="p2">
Not the least important or successful among the
foraging expeditions at this time sent out from Panamá
was one under Espinosa, who with a hundred
and fifty men embarked in one of the brigantines in
search of the gold that Badajoz had lost. Ah! that
gold; the Spaniards could scarcely sleep for thinking
of it. But now the licentiate should judicially recover
it; then might Panamá have rest.
</p>

<p>
Dropping westward a few leagues, Espinosa anchored
at the mouth of a small river flowing through
the province of Cutara, called after the son of the late
Paris who now ruled that province. Ascending the
river in canoes the Spaniards surprised by night the
village, and no opposition being offered, the robbers
took such plate, provisions, cotton cloth, and Indian
weapons as they could lay their hands on. It then
occurred to the more ghoulish of the company to
search the death-chamber of the cacique Paris, whose
body was then lying in state. And there, to their
unutterable joy and thankfulness, round the corpse
were not only the golden plates before captured, but
piles of vessels and ornaments of the same blessed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_469' href='#Page_469'>469</a></span>
metal. By this desecration, gold to the value of forty
thousand castellanos was secured, which made glad
the heart of the old governor at Panamá. And who
shall say the learned licentiate was not an humane and
pious man, a just judge and good Christian withal,
when after taking the trouble to drive the inhabitants
of that village captives to the sea, he liberated them
all at the entreaty of the youthful cacique, who had
followed them wildly wailing, and faithfully promising
a ransom of as much more gold as had been already
taken? On the way back the licentiate stopped at the
landing of the cacique Biruquete, of whom he bought
a cargo of maize, without paying for it. Lest the
treasure should fall into improper hands, half of it
was buried at Panamá by Pedrarias and Espinosa;
with the remainder the worthy couple set out immediately
for Antigua, where the latter paid over the
king's share, and then made preparations for a voyage
of discovery along the coast, toward the north-west.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE STUBBORN CABILDO.</div>

<p class="p2">
It occurred to Pedrarias that while Espinosa was
absent from Darien with the men and ships making
discoveries, it would be well for him to visit Spain and
place his declining power on a firmer basis. But in
order to leave he must have permission from the chief
authority, or else lay down his office and submit to a
residencia. Since the Jeronimite Fathers had made
the cabildo of Antigua their agent to watch Pedrarias,
and if possible keep him within the bounds of humanity
and decency, he applied to it for permission to
leave the country, and was refused. It was very
hard, he said, that the king's governor should be thus
subject to check by a vulgar town council; but the
friars at Santo Domingo must be obeyed.
</p>

<p>
Since he could not go to Spain Pedrarias wrote the
royal authorities there, setting forth what he had done
at Panamá, soliciting a South Sea government for
himself, and the removal of the municipality and
cathedral of Antigua to the new city. Again, midst
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_470' href='#Page_470'>470</a></span>
much storming, he applied for leave, saying he had
been chosen <i>procurador</i> in Castile; and again he was
refused permission. Then he dissembled, spoke softly,
and said he loved the councilmen as his children, but
nothing availed.
</p>

<p>
An act of this council, passed during his absence,
greatly exasperated him, as tending to show a disregard
for his authority. This was the granting of
a request by Diego de Albites to plant a colony on
the coast of Veragua. Fearing that the friars might
impose upon him further restrictions he abruptly broke
off all conference with the council of Antigua, and proceeded
to Panamá.
</p>

<p>
There he found the soldiers and colonists more than
ever dissatisfied. Provisions were scarce, and there
was fever among them, and they said, Espinosa among
the rest, if they were to become citizens, they would
prefer the pure air of Spain to this pest-hole. "Very
well," replied the governor, "let the gold be unearthed,
and that with all the rest returned to the people of
Paris, as the Jeronimite Fathers have ordered, and
let us return to Castile. I assuredly can live there
without hunger." A threat from Pedrarias to do
a righteous act was uncommon and terrifying. The
disaffected were silenced; and while Pedrarias yielded
so far as to agree to the search for a more favorable
country to the westward, it was at the same time
determined that the building of Panamá should be
proceeded with.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE DOINGS OF ALBITES.</div>

<p>
Meanwhile the cabildo of Antigua proceeded as best
it could with the establishing of a northern seaport.
By several successful raids on the north coast, toward
Veragua, Diego de Albites had accumulated wealth,
and with wealth ambition more vaulting. During the
war between Vasco Nuñez and Pedrarias he pictured
to himself political dissolution, and sent to Spain
Andres Niño, a pilot, and two thousand castellanos to
purchase for him a South Sea government. Better
skilled in navigation than in diplomacy Niño returned
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_471' href='#Page_471'>471</a></span>
without the office and without the money. At another
time, while left in command at Acla during Vasco
Nuñez' absence at the South Sea, Albites slipped
cable and sailed for Española, where he applied for
authority to build a town at Nombre de Dios or
establish a colony on the coast of Veragua. Referred
by the friars to Pedrarias, as an excuse for his
absence he enlisted sixty men, loaded his ships with
much-needed provisions, and returned to receive the
thanks of the governor whom he had sought to circumvent.
For this faithful service he received permission
from Pedrarias to make an incursion into the
province of Veragua, which greatly offended Vasco
Nuñez; and when Albites returned successful from
this raid the cabildo at Antigua granted him permission
to establish a settlement not only in that province,
but at Nombre de Dios, to Pedrarias' extreme annoyance.<a id='FA_XIII-9' href='#FN_XIII-9' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-9]</a>
</p>

<p>
It was in 1517 that Albites returned to Antigua
from Veragua, Chagre, and Nombre de Dios with
much gold and many slaves. According to Herrera
he attempted an expedition to Veragua in 1518, but
was driven back to Nombre de Dios, where he founded
a city. Andagoya is correct, however, when he places
the settlement of Nombre de Dios in the latter part
of 1519, though it was not by order of Pedrarias as
he affirms. Embarking from Antigua in a brigantine
and caravel, Albites touched at the isle of Bastimentos,
and coasted westward a few leagues, raiding
upon the natives for gold with meagre results. One
of the ships becoming leaky he returned to Bastimentos,
where it foundered. Thence he was conveyed
by the cacique in canoes to Nombre de Dios, and at
once set about building a town.
</p>

<p>
Two opposite posts being thus established, a road
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_472' href='#Page_472'>472</a></span>
was constructed from sea to sea, "through the mountains
overgrown with thick woods never touched from
all eternity," as Peter Martyr expresses it. At great
labor and cost both to the crown and to the colonists,
a way wide enough for vehicles was cut through
the thickets; trees were felled and thrown into the
marshes, obstructing rocks torn from their beds, and
bridges made where necessary.<a id='FA_XIII-10' href='#FN_XIII-10' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-10]</a> Thus was opened
through primeval shades a passage for the blessings
and the curses of that Atlantic civilization which was
to illuminate the Pacific.
</p>

<p class="p2">
This same year the lucky licentiate and alcalde
mayor, Gaspar de Espinosa, was gaining further renown
as discoverer and treasure-seeker. With Juan
de Castañeda as pilot, he coasted one hundred and
eighty leagues toward the north-west, touching at
Huistá, Natá, Chirú, Chame, and other posts, and
returned to Panamá well laden with maize and other
provisions, and gold to the value of thirty-three thousand
castellanos. During this exploration he entered
a gulf to which he gave the name Culebras,<a id='FA_XIII-11' href='#FN_XIII-11' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-11]</a> from
the many snakes of various colors seen there.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">INOPPORTUNE DEATH OF SOSA.</div>

<p class="p2">
A stroke of better fortune than he deserved likewise
befell Pedrarias not long after. In May, 1520,
Lope de Sosa, with three hundred men, arrived and
anchored in the harbor of Antigua. Pedrarias, who
was there at the time, immediately made preparations
to receive him with becoming ceremony. Having
given orders concerning his disembarkation, the new
governor entered his cabin to dress. While there he
was seized with a sudden illness, from which he shortly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_473' href='#Page_473'>473</a></span>
after expired. With mournful pomp and outward
demonstration of grief Pedrarias conveyed the body
to the church and buried it before the altar. Juan
Alonso de Sosa, the son, and all the followers of the
late governor were treated with that show of distinction
which the old courtier could so well assume.
Juan Rodriguez de Alarconcillo, who came as alcalde
mayor, and before whom the residencia of the outgoing
governor would have been taken, was favored with
marked consideration. By way of prudence, some
time before the anticipated arrival of his judge Pedrarias
had sent his wife to Spain with all his gold
and pearls.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Sosa's appointment to supersede Pedrarias was one
of the reformatory measures which the chronicler
Oviedo claims to have effected while in Spain.<a id='FA_XIII-12' href='#FN_XIII-12' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-12]</a> For
himself he had obtained, besides the offices of veedor
and escribano-general, those of collector of chamber
penalties and <i>regidor perpetuo</i> of Antigua. Orders
were issued, furthermore, to all New World governors
to furnish him a truthful report of all their acts, so
that he might complete the General History of the
Indies already begun. He was also appointed receiver
of the property of Vasco Nuñez and his accomplices
which had been confiscated to the king. He
arrived at Antigua with his wife and two children
soon after Sosa.
</p>

<p>
But the heart of the scholar was not in the coarse
cunning of Darien politics; he became discontented,
irritable, and while commanding the respect of the
colonists he was not popular with them. They did
not want reform so much as plunder. Pedrarias was
his enemy, as he was the enemy of every well-meaning
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_474' href='#Page_474'>474</a></span>
man of ability. The deaths first of a boy and
then of his wife did not tend to sweeten his disposition.
"Many times would I have returned to Spain,"
he exclaims, "had not need and shame prevented me."
</p>

<p>
The powers of the governor having been enlarged
by means of the veedor, Oviedo's was the first head
on which they were visited. The principal quarrel
was over the depopulation of the northern coast. The
veedor protested in the king's name, but the governor,
now lord of all, was determined to execute his cherished
project while he possessed the power. There
was no longer any need of a north-coast capital; Pedrarias
would make Panamá his metropolis. Before
introducing further changes, however, it was necessary
that his residencia should be taken. But this, with
his experience, need be nothing more than an arraignment
and trial of himself. At his request the licentiate
Alarconcillo published the residencia for thirty
days, during which time the governor continued to exercise
the functions of office; no one appeared against
him, and a certificate of the proceeding was sent to
Spain. Pedrarias then took up his permanent abode
at Panamá.
</p>

<p>
Not long afterward the veedor and contador were
obliged to visit Panamá to weigh some gold and receive
the royal share, since the governor would no
longer send the metal to Antigua. The contador
took up his residence there, but Oviedo returned to
Antigua, more than ever determined to stand by that
city. Seeing which Pedrarias was satisfied he could
no more effectually ruin his adversary than by permitting
him to have his own way. Besides, it were as
well to stop the tongue and pen of one who could
make and unmake governors. So when next Oviedo
complained Pedrarias answered, "Señor Veedor, since
you know so well how to achieve such desirable results,
accept from me what power I possess, and govern
Antigua according to your pleasure."
</p>

<div class="sidenote">OVIEDO AS RULER.</div>

<p>
After some hesitation Oviedo accepted the proposal,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_475' href='#Page_475'>475</a></span>
and presented his credentials to the municipal council
in November, 1521. Opening his administration with
the enthusiasm of a novice, he straightway set about
correcting abuses. He forbade blasphemy, keeping
mistresses, and selling or eating meat on Saturday.
He prohibited gambling, and burned all the cards in
the public square. A dishonest notary was required
to make restitution fourfold and be suspended from
office for one year. Indian women must no longer be
employed as beasts of burden, and Indian children
must not be sold and bought as slaves. Certain more
practicable provisions, however, saved Antigua, for a
time, from the effects of a morality which standing
alone would have killed any colony in the Indies.
The new ruler bought for small sums the houses of
those leaving, and sold them to new-comers at cost.
He erected a market, opened mines, built ships, and
sent out expeditions to smooth the ruffled plumage
of the savage. He made of old iron five hundred
hatchets, which were sold to the Indians; and when
they became dulled, their owners not knowing how to
sharpen them, he placed on board a vessel three large
grindstones, covered so that the uncivilized might not
steal the secret, and proceeded along the coast grinding
such implements as the Indians brought, and
charging therefor a sum equal to the original cost,
which was cheerfully paid. It is claimed that more
than seven thousand castellanos were thus secured
during one voyage.
</p>

<p>
A greater prosperity followed these measures than
pleased Pedrarias. But by revoking the many decisions
of his deputy that came up on appeal from
dissatisfied colonists, the governor was enabled to
render Oviedo's position one of little power.
</p>

<p>
The staff of officials was increased by yet another
alcalde mayor, the licentiate Sancho de Salaya, for
the South Sea government particularly, who arrived
at Antigua in a caravel from Spain, the 1st of July,
1522. With him came Rodrigo Perez, the friend of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_476' href='#Page_476'>476</a></span>
Vasco Nuñez, vicar when sent in chains to Spain,
but returned arch-deacon.<a id='FA_XIII-13' href='#FN_XIII-13' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-13]</a>
</p>

<p>
About this time a rebellion broke out on the Rio
Grande San Juan, caused by outrages perpetrated by
the bachiller Corral and Martin Estete during a foraging
expedition. Heedless of the warning of Oviedo,
Martin de Murga, visitador of the Indians, in company
with three Spaniards and ten friendly Indians,
paid a visit to Bea, the cacique of this province, who
slew the entire party. Juan de Escaray with forty
men was sent against the revolted chieftain.
</p>

<p>
Soon after some christianized Indians came down
from the mountains, eight leagues distant, and reported
outrages on them by the cacique Corobari. Thirty-five
men were sent to capture him, and when brought
in, Salaya sentenced him to be burned; after which the
licentiate proceeded to Panamá. Several spies caught
near Antigua about the same time confessed under
torture to an insurrection contemplated by the cacique
Guaturo, who had joined Bea. It was his plan to fire
the town and slay the inhabitants. Oviedo in person,
with forty men, proceeded against the new rebel, who,
with several of the conspirators, was captured and
hanged. This was the last of the wars of Antigua.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">OVIEDO RETIRES.</div>

<p>
At length it pleased Pedrarias to depose Oviedo,
and appoint in his place the bachiller Corral, who had
shortly before incurred the anger of the chronicler,
and had by him been sent in chains to Spain, on the
charge of having there a wife while living himself in
the Indies. The ubiquitous bachiller re-appeared at
Antigua, however, almost in a twinkling. Of course,
the chronicler was very indignant. The revocation
was read in council; whereupon Oviedo laid his staff
of office on the chair which he had occupied as president,
and took his seat among the members, saying,
"This is my place, given me by the emperor; here
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_477' href='#Page_477'>477</a></span>
will I henceforth serve their Majesties, as in duty
bound, and here only." Accompanying the revocation
was a decree from Pedrarias, authorizing the city of
Antigua to elect a representative to a general assembly,
to be convened at Panamá for the purpose of
providing measures important to the province, and to
elect <i>procuradores de córtes</i>, or members of Congress
to send to Spain. Pedrarias preferred Espinosa to
represent Antigua, for obvious reasons; but instead
of sending a delegate to the junta at Panamá, the
people of Antigua chose their own representative in
the person of Oviedo. While waiting for a vessel
Oviedo occupied himself by presenting charges against
Pedrarias before the new alcalde mayor, Alarconcillo,
who had ordered a second residencia of the governor,
and also one of Espinosa. For this pastime he not
only narrowly escaped paying with his life, at the
hand of an assassin, but Pedrarias ordered his late
lieutenant's own residencia to be taken, and even
placed him in irons until bonds should be given. The
trial was passed without further damage than a fine
of twenty castellanos for sending Corral to Spain.
Another attempt being made at murder, Oviedo on
the 3d of July, 1523, stole away, embarking ostensibly
for Nombre de Dios, but bearing off, he directed his
course toward Cuba and Jamaica, and thence sailed
to Spain. Verily, these were the days of dissimulation.

</p>

<p>
The pilot Andrés Niño was an enterprising fellow,
not to be put down by any slight frown of fortune. He
had lately seen service with Vasco Nuñez, and would,
God willing, follow the fantasy thence engendered.
If two thousand castellanos could not buy a small
slice of dominion on the North Sea, he would try the
South. And in the mind of Niño, as with other navigators
of that day, the undiscovered South assumed
fantastic shape. There was the originally created
strait, actual though invisible, leading to the Spice
Islands hard by. Why should not one pilot as well
as another sail through that strait to those fragrant
shores, even though the voyage must be begun by
crossing a little strip of cordillera?
</p>

<p>
Such was New World geography in 1519, when the
inspired pilot found himself in Spain, soliciting the
Council of the Indies for the ships of Vasco Nuñez,
in which to make his voyage to the Moluccas; for, if so
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_479' href='#Page_479'>479</a></span>
be he might get there for the asking, it would save
him much trouble. Niño had come under the patronage
of Alonso de la Puente, the royal treasurer, and
accompanied by Andrés de Cereceda; but the persuasive
eloquence of the worthy pilot was wanting in
the soft, seductive tones that come from the ring of
precious metals, and a second time Bellerophon fell to
earth.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHARACTER OF GIL GONZALEZ.</div>

<p>
It happened that the contador of Española, Gil
Gonzalez Dávila,<a id='FA_XIV-1' href='#FN_XIV-1' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-1]</a> was then at the court of Spain; and
it was suggested to Niño, who seemed to have exhausted
all his resources, that if he could engage that
gentleman's interest in the enterprise, it would be
equivalent to its accomplishment. For he was a man
of no small influence, springing from a good family of
Ávila, and having been formerly attached to the household
of the all-potential bishop of Búrgos. Possessed
of exceptional ability and integrity, he had been
sometimes sent by the government on missions of importance
and trust, and was engaged in one of them
when first we met him at Santo Domingo, investigating
the affairs of the defaulting treasurer, Santa Clara.
His energy was of the substantial cast, authoritative,
robust, and direct. He seldom made mistakes, either
in men or measures; and seemingly was strongest
when standing at ease. Neither so bold as Vasco
Nuñez, nor so cunning as Pedrarias, nor so cruel as Pizarro,
nor so learned as Espinosa, he was a man of deeper
and broader experience than any one of them, with
a more evenly balanced mind, a cooler, sounder judgment,
not always a warrant for greater success than
with a more senseless recklessness, but on the whole
much safer as a colleague, and more reliable as a friend.
He was not a man easily diverted by hollow schemes,
however brilliant or high-soaring; but when Niño laid
before him his plans, he saw at once that they were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_480' href='#Page_480'>480</a></span>
eminently practical. There were the ships, and there
the undiscovered sea, of which was already known
that its shores abounded in gold and pearls, guarded
by naked and almost weaponless men—this, and little
more. What more was wanted? It did not require
a Periander to tell the accomplished contador that this
was no ordinary opportunity. Fonseca, who had always
retained a warm interest in his protégé, heartily
approved the plan, and the details were soon arranged
with Niño. Gil Gonzalez was to be captain-general
of the expedition; to him was given the habit of
Santiago, and he was recommended to the newly
appointed governor of Castilla del Oro, Lope de Sosa.
Niño was to be a partner in the enterprise, with the
position of pilot. Cereceda was chosen contador of
the discovery.<a id='FA_XIV-2' href='#FN_XIV-2' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-2]</a>
</p>

<p>
A royal order<a id='FA_XIV-3' href='#FN_XIV-3' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-3]</a> was issued at Barcelona the 18th of
June, 1519, directing the governor of Castilla del Oro
to deliver to Gil Gonzalez the vessels built by Vasco
Nuñez, and authorizing an expedition for South Sea
discovery, the expense of which was to be borne
largely by the crown. With this cédula Lope de Sosa
promised faithfully to comply.
</p>

<p>
During the year following the execution of these
documents Andrés Niño so bestirred himself, that his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_481' href='#Page_481'>481</a></span>
captain-general was enabled to land at Acla with two
hundred men, prior to the arrival at Antigua of Lope
de Sosa. Pedrarias was incensed that any one should
presume to intermeddle in Tierra Firme affairs. Gil
Gonzalez nevertheless despatched to him with the
royal order Juan de Sauce, who duly delivered it in
the presence of the notary Martin Estete.<a id='FA_XIV-4' href='#FN_XIV-4' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-4]</a>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">RECEPTION OF A CÉDULA.</div>

<p>
It is worth witnessing the reception by this arch-hypocrite
of a royal command. "And forthwith the
said lieutenant-general," writes the notary, "took the
said cédula of his Highness in his hands, and kissed it,
and placed it on his head, and said that he would obey
it, and that he did obey it with the utmost reverence
he could and ought, as a letter and commandment of
his king and natural lord, whom may it please God
our Lord to let live and reign during many and long
years, with increase of kingdoms and seignories; and,
as to the fulfilment thereof, that his lordship would
see to it, and answer and provide thereupon as might
be conducive to his Highness' service."
</p>

<p>
In which pathetic demonstration no one who knew
Pedrarias could doubt that he never for a moment
intended to do as he had said. Rather than tamely
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_482' href='#Page_482'>482</a></span>
admit a new and dangerous rival, high in reputation
and royal favor, some risk might be run. And so he
at first agreed, then delayed, interposing technicalities
and pretexts, and finally refused to deliver the ships,
alleging as an excuse that they were private property,
and claimed as such by individuals. In vain the captain-general
urged that this was not a question of
rights of property, but of royal command, which to
disobey was dangerous. Pedrarias stood his ground;
and fortune sustained him in the death of Sosa, who,
had he lived, would have made all well for the expedition.
But in Gil Gonzalez the old governor found his
match; for the captain-general was no less decided
than he, and far quicker in resources.
</p>

<p>
What Gil Gonzalez did was to copy the magnificent
performance of Vasco Nuñez, under the circumstances
scarcely less creditable in the imitation than in the
original. After strengthening his command by recruits
from the officers and men of the Pedrarias government,
among whom were the treasurer Puente and
the contador Diego Marquez, he dismantled his ships,
packed up the sails and cordage, and taking from the
hulls the iron, and such of the timbers as better suited
the purpose than those freshly cut, which were also
necessary, he secured the services of some Indians, and
transported his vessels across the sierra to the same
Rio Balsas used by Balboa. There he constructed
and launched four vessels, but lost them all before
reaching the mouth of the river.<a id='FA_XIV-5' href='#FN_XIV-5' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-5]</a> The party, reduced
in number more than one half since leaving Acla,<a id='FA_XIV-6' href='#FN_XIV-6' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-6]</a>
now crossed in canoes to the Pearl Islands.
</p>

<p>
A letter directed to Pedrarias in this emergency
was productive of no results. Gil Gonzalez again requested
possession of the vessels of Vasco Nuñez; his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_483' href='#Page_483'>483</a></span>
messenger brought back a surly verbal refusal. The
captain-general then presented himself in person before
the governor and demanded at least men for the
building of new ships. Pedrarias dared not offer
further opposition; and in time four small and poorly
equipped vessels lay at the Pearl Islands ready for sea.<a id='FA_XIV-7' href='#FN_XIV-7' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-7]</a>
"In all my experience while in the service of your
Majesty," writes Gil Gonzalez to the king, "I have nowhere
been handled so roughly as in crossing Tierra
Firme with the men I had brought from Castile,
having to support them for two years, and spend my
goods and jewels on them, and build the ships twice
over."<a id='FA_XIV-8' href='#FN_XIV-8' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-8]</a>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE VOYAGE NORTH-WESTWARD.</div>

<p class="p2">
Embarking the 21st of January, 1522, having on
board a few horses, with arms and articles for traffic,
Gil Gonzalez struck westward, and after sailing one
hundred leagues he was obliged to beach three of his
vessels to save them from the worms, while the fourth
returned to Panamá for pitch and other articles for
repairs. New water-casks had likewise to be made,
as those on board were failing through the rotting of
the hoops.<a id='FA_XIV-9' href='#FN_XIV-9' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-9]</a> Leaving the ships in charge of Andrés
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_484' href='#Page_484'>484</a></span>
Niño, with orders to follow the coast for eighty or a
hundred leagues, and there in some safe harbor to
await him, Gil Gonzalez with one hundred men and
four horses continued his way by land. Poor food, a
hot sun, with heavy rains and softened ground, made
the journey excessively irksome. The wading of
rivers while the body was heated brought upon the
commander a cramp, so that he had to be carried.
Thus they trudged for many days, gathering gold,
and christianizing the country, meeting no resistance.
</p>

<p>
Presently they came to what they called an island,
ten leagues in length by six in breadth, "formed by
the branches of a river," which was no island, however,
but the peninsula which forms the western side of
the Golfo Dulce.<a id='FA_XIV-10' href='#FN_XIV-10' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-10]</a> Here in a huge wooden shed, as
high as a tower, which the chroniclers please to call a
palace, dwelt the ruler of that land, who was invited
to retire while the strangers took possession in the
upper part, the lower being flooded. For a fortnight
they sheltered themselves from the falling waters.
One night the palace posts began slowly to sink into
the softened earth. The outlook was not encouraging.
Their only shelter was sinking, and with it they were
being submerged. They saved themselves, however,
by cutting through the roof, and thus made their way
out, bearing the commander on their shoulders. They
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_485' href='#Page_485'>485</a></span>
were then obliged to take to trees, and to dwell in them
for several days, the commander's quarters being a
blanket stretched between two branches. During the
flood were lost many weapons and much plunder.
</p>

<p>
After this they proceeded, sometimes going inland
for food, but groping along the shore as best they
might. Once when obliged to seek the ocean ten
leagues away, they descended a river on rafts, one of
which floated out to sea in the dark, but was brought
to shore next morning by a lucky breeze and some
expert swimming. Finally, after visiting and robbing
a number of petty chieftains, and securing gold to
the value of forty thousand pesos, they came to a
gulf<a id='FA_XIV-11' href='#FN_XIV-11' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-11]</a> which Gil Gonzalez called San Vicente, and
where to his great joy he found Andrés Niño with
the ships.
</p>

<p>
Owing to his lameness Gil Gonzalez would have
embarked by sea, sending Niño with the land party;
but the men lost courage at the prospect of remaining
on shore without their leader, because the caciques
were becoming more powerful. He accordingly bound
Niño by oath to explore the coast with two ships,
slowly and by day only, and reckon the distance sailed,
leaving the other two vessels with the gold in San
Vicente Gulf, while he himself plunged boldly inland,
determined to subjugate the people, peaceably, if possible,
otherwise by force.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">NICOYA.</div>

<p>
Among the caciques whom Gil Gonzalez met was
one most powerful living near the northern end of
the gulf, named Nicoya, who gave a friendly reception
as a friend, and presented him with gold to the
value of fourteen thousand castellanos. When told
of God, and of the bliss of heaven and the pains of
hell, Nicoya very sensibly preferred the former place,
and permitted himself, his wives and subjects, to the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_486' href='#Page_486'>486</a></span>
number of over six thousand souls, to be baptized.
Furthermore he gave up six golden idols, each of a
span in length, "For being now a Christian," said he,
"I shall have nothing more to do with them." Which
emblems of perdition the Spaniards did by no means
scruple to take.
</p>

<p>
Nicoya was a great chief, but there was a mightier
than he, fifty leagues to the northward, whose name
was Nicaragua, of whom Nicoya said: "He is wise
as well as valiant, and your little army will quickly
melt before his warrior host."
</p>

<p>
It will be observed that the peaceful policy adopted
in this expedition had thus far proved successful beyond
that of any other similar attempt in the Indies.
The sword remained sheathed, and it was found profitable
as well as humane to keep it so. Hence these
gentle robbers walked the land triumphant. The
truth is, for the times Gil Gonzalez was an honest man.
He tells large stories about baptizing, as we shall see;
but we are accustomed to some degree of exaggeration
where proselyting is concerned, and Gil Gonzalez
really believed that the Christianity he gave Nicoya
paid him well for his gold. Beside being honest, Gil
Gonzalez was humane; he did not delight in blood.
Let us doublemark these traits, for they are rare hereabouts.
</p>

<p>
How different was this from the usual form with
which the captains of Pedrarias introduced themselves
to savagism, may be seen in the approach by Gil Gonzalez
to a people of doubtful temper. When within
one day's march of Nicaragua's town he despatched
to that chieftain an embassy of six Indians and two
interpreters to notify him of his proximity and character.
"Tell him," said Gonzalez, "that a captain
cometh, commissioned to these parts by the great
king of the Christians, to tell all the lords of these
lands that there is in the heavens, higher than the
sun, one lord, maker of all things, and that those
believing and obeying him shall at death ascend to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_487' href='#Page_487'>487</a></span>
that loftiness, while disbelievers shall be driven into
the fire beneath the earth. Tell him to be ready to
hear and accept these truths, or else to prepare for
battle."
</p>

<div class="sidenote">NICARAGUA.</div>

<p>
Nicoya spoke the truth when he pronounced Nicaragua
a wise man. There is great advantage in
possessing an intellect unclouded by learning. He was
both wise and honest enough to manifest amazement
when messengers brought to him things amazing.
"Tell those who sent you," said Nicaragua, "that I
know not their king and therefore cannot do him
homage; that I fear not their sharp swords, but love
peace rather than war; gold has little value, they are
welcome to what I have. In regard to the religion
they teach I will talk with them, and if I like it I
will adopt it." Of the two messages, that of the savage
was far the more logical and sensible.
</p>

<p>
Next day when within one league of the town the
Spaniards were met by four of Nicaragua's principal
men, who told them that the king awaited their
coming in peace. On entering the town they were
received by Nicaragua, who assigned them lodgings
in the public square, and placed all the surrounding
houses at their disposal.
</p>

<p>
After the presentation of gifts, which, voluntary
or forced, was always first in order, and which in
this instance consisted on one side of gold to the
value of fifteen thousand castellanos, and on the other
of a shirt, a red cap, and a silken dress, attention was
turned to spiritual affairs. To a lengthy harangue on
what the savage must do and not do in order to attain
Christian salvation, Nicaragua replied: "I see no
harm in it. We cannot, however, give up our war-paint
and weapons, our gay decorations and dances,
and become women!"
</p>

<p>
Before accepting baptism<a id='FA_XIV-12' href='#FN_XIV-12' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-12]</a> Nicaragua desired to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_488' href='#Page_488'>488</a></span>
ask Gil Gonzalez a few questions. "You who know
so much of the maker and of the making of this
world, tell me," said he, "of the great flood; and will
there be another? In the universal end, will the earth
be overturned, or will the sky fall and destroy us?
Whence do the sun and moon obtain their light, and
how will they lose it? How large are the stars; how
are they held in the sky, and moved about? Why are
the nights made dark, and the winters cold; why did
not the Christian's God make a better world; what
honor is due him; and what rights and duties has
man, under whose dominion are the beasts? Whither
goes the soul which you hold to be immortal when it
leaves the body? Does the Pope never die; and is
the great king of Spain a mortal; and why do the
Christians so love gold?" These and other questions
of like import the savage asked, and Gil Gonzalez
answered them. There was no question that brave
and pious Gil Gonzalez could not answer. And Peter
Martyr says that "Cereceda, the king's treasurer,
witnessed the manner in which Gonzalez answered
the questions of Nicaragua." Strange to say, the savage
was not satisfied. Doubtless Gil Gonzalez could
have made himself better understood by a Christian.
"Came these men hither from heaven?" whispered
Nicaragua to the interpreter. "They came from
heaven," was the reply. "But how?" asked Nicaragua,
"directly down, like the flight of an arrow, or
riding a cloud, or in a circuit like a bent bow?" The
interpreter could not tell.
</p>

<p>
Nicaragua finally consented to have the idols in
his temple removed, and the Christian's cross placed
in their stead. A specimen of the worship they
had adopted was then given them with great solemnity.
Upon a high mound, whose summit was
reached by steps, Gil Gonzalez had planted the cross on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_489' href='#Page_489'>489</a></span>
first entering the town. A procession headed by the
Spanish and the native leaders now marched solemnly
about the town, and ascended the steps of the mound<a id='FA_XIV-13' href='#FN_XIV-13' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-13]</a>
on their knees, chanting their hymns of praise the
while. Proceeding to the temple, they erected there
an altar, and jointly placed upon it the sacred emblem,
in token the one of giving and the other of receiving
the true faith. Such was the conquest and conversion
of Nicaragua, unique and spiritual.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE FRESHWATER SEA.</div>

<p>
Nicaragua's town stood on a large fresh-water sea,<a id='FA_XIV-14' href='#FN_XIV-14' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-14]</a>
into which Gil Gonzalez rode his horse and took possession,
drinking of the water. It was barely three
leagues from the South Sea; but there was no connection,
and a canoe sent out upon it could discover
no current. "The pilots I had with me," writes the
commander in his narrative of the expedition, "certify
that it opens into the North Sea; and if so it is a
great discovery, as the distance from one sea to the
other is but two or three leagues of very level road."<a id='FA_XIV-15' href='#FN_XIV-15' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-15]</a>
One other matter claimed the attention of the discoverer
at this juncture; which was to ascertain whether
the invaders of Mexico, whose conquest was known
at Panamá prior to the sailing of this expedition, had
carried their operations so far south as this point.
After close inquiry among the natives Gil Gonzalez
was satisfied that they had not.<a id='FA_XIV-16' href='#FN_XIV-16' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-16]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_490' href='#Page_490'>490</a></span>
</p>

<p>
April of this year, 1522, was now at hand, and Gil
Gonzalez, well satisfied thus far, must determine what
next to do. Before he was aware of it, baptism had
become the rage in all that region. His stay at Nicaragua
had been for eight days. Then he went forward
north-westwardly six leagues into the next province,
and found there a cluster of six towns, of two thousand
inhabitants each, all the towns being less than
two leagues apart. These people, jealous lest Nicaragua
should secure to himself all the efficacies of the
mysterious rite, came forward in multitudes to receive
it, freely giving the Spaniards gold and food and
slaves.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">DIRIANGEN.</div>

<p>
Yet farther before the visitors spread their fame,
until a powerful cacique, called Diriangen, came in great
state from some distance to meet them. To make
the most imposing appearance possible, when within
a short distance of the Spaniards Diriangen halted,
and arranged his train. Five hundred unarmed men
advanced, each carrying one or two turkeys, whose
gay plumage made brilliant the spectacle. After
them came ten banner-men, their flags yet furled.
Then followed seventeen women nearly covered with
plates of gold; after which were five trumpeters; and
lastly, the chief men of the nation, bearing on their
shoulders a palanquin richly adorned with colored
cloths and feathers, in which sat the potentate. The
cortége then moved forward and entered the village
where the Spaniards were encamped, drawing up in
perfect order before the commander's quarters. The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_491' href='#Page_491'>491</a></span>
litter was placed on the ground, the ten white banners
were unfurled, and the trumpeters blew a shrill melody.
Presently Diriangen ordered the musicians to
cease, and approaching Gil Gonzalez he touched his
hand. Then turning to the women, he ordered the gold
to be presented, including two hundred golden hatchets,
which amounted altogether in value to eighteen
thousand castellanos. The five hundred Indians now
came forward, and after severally touching the hand
of the commander, presented the fowls to him. "For
what purpose," asked Gil Gonzalez of the chieftain,
"have you come so far to meet me?" Diriangen answered:
"Having learned that a wonderful people,
bearded and riding upon beasts, had arrived in this
land, I come that with my own eyes I may behold
them, and offer such hospitality as is in my power."
Gil Gonzalez thanked the chieftain courteously, presented
him some European articles, and after further
conversation asked him if he did not wish to become
a Christian, and a subject of the king of Spain. Diriangen
intimated that it would give him great pleasure
to accept both of these flattering proposals, but that
he first desired to confer with his women and priests;
he would return answer within three days.
</p>

<p>
Now Diriangen was a wily lord, who cared not a jot
for the king of Spain, or for his religion. He wished
to see this spectacle, and he was willing to pay royally
for admission to it. The faith his fathers had held
was sufficient for him, and he preferred ruling himself
rather than being subject to another. He believed
he could vanquish that little company; at all events
he would try. With these reflections he bid the
Spaniards a warm adieu, mounted his litter, and was
carried away. This was on the 14th of April.
</p>

<p>
Three days after, while the clergyman of the expedition
was absent at a neighboring town whither he had
gone mounted on the best horse and attended by two
valiant men, to preach, and the Spaniards were taking
their mid-day siesta, Diriangen came down upon
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_492' href='#Page_492'>492</a></span>
them with three thousand<a id='FA_XIV-17' href='#FN_XIV-17' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-17]</a> men, armed with flint-toothed
swords, lances, and arrows, and mailed in coats
of wadded cotton, and was within a cross-bow shot
of them before the alarm was given. Gil Gonzalez
sprang upon one of the three remaining horses, and
shouted to his men to rally in front of his dwelling,
which faced the square. He then placed one third of
his force in the rear of the house, fearful lest the
enemy should fire it, for it contained all their gold.
By this time the square was filled with Diriangen's
warriors, who gave immediate battle, hand to hand.
The swift death-blows of the Spaniards seemed to
carry no special terror with them, and for a time it
was extremely doubtful how the fight would turn.
The Indians brought six Spaniards to the ground, and
captured one, whom, however, they manifested no disposition
to kill. Finally, upon a charge of the commander
and the two other horsemen with their lances,
the enemy gave way and were driven out of the town.
Gil Gonzalez recklessly pursued, until wearied with
killing, and alone, he turned, when there fell on him a
shower of stones and darts which hurried him back to
his people. Diriangen had kept in the background
during the battle, and disappeared immediately it was
over. None of the Spaniards were lost. The captive
was recovered; the priest returned in safety, and the
Indians were finally permitted to carry off their dead.
Luckily Gil Gonzalez had taken the precaution to increase
the number of bearded men by cutting hair
from the heads of Spaniards and fixing it to the chins
of twenty-five young natives of his company.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">RESULTS OF THE EXPEDITION.</div>

<p>
After due consultation it was decided to terminate
the exploration at this point and return to Panamá.
They had obtained a large amount of gold, and had
baptized many. The results from the conversions,
however, would have been far more pleasing to the
Spaniards had not so many of the Indians apostatized
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_493' href='#Page_493'>493</a></span>
before their back was fairly turned. As the
Spaniards entered the province of Nicaragua, on the
way to their ships, a plan of that sapient ruler was
revealed to Gil Gonzalez, none other than to repeat
the experiment of Diriangen. Immediately sixty
Spaniards, all who were at present sound, formed
into a hollow square, so as to act defensively and
offensively while marching, having the invalids and
treasure in the centre, and at each corner a horseman
and an arquebusier. As they passed by Nicaragua's
town the natives cried out to the carriers, who had
been lent the Spaniards by Nicaragua, to throw down
their loads. To this the Spaniards made no reply;
but when the natives attempted by force to accomplish
their purpose, Gil Gonzalez hurried forward the
weakest of his force, and placed himself with seventeen
men in the rear. A desultory fight was kept
up for some distance, during which the cargo-bearers
managed to throw down their loads and escape, to
the unutterable disgust of the Spaniards, who were
thus obliged to carry them. Gaining nothing by
this, but rather losing, the natives made peace. Nicaragua,
by his messengers, disclaimed any agency in
the attack, but the Spaniards had recognized some of
his principal men among the assailants. At length
they reached the gulf of San Vicente in safety, eight
days after the return of the party discovering by sea.
Niño had coasted three hundred and fifty leagues
north-westerly, reaching, according to some estimates,
the very southern limit of Cortés' conquests. Hardly
any details, however, are given beyond the statement
that he discovered a large bay which Gil Gonzalez
named Fonseca, in honor of his friend and patron the
bishop of Búrgos. To an island within this bay he
gave the name of his own niece, Petronila.<a id='FA_XIV-18' href='#FN_XIV-18' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-18]</a> Returning,
the expedition reached Panamá, June 25, 1523,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_494' href='#Page_494'>494</a></span>
with gold in value to 112,000 pesos, half of which was
of inferior quality. According to his reckoning Gil
Gonzalez had coasted six hundred and fifty leagues,
travelling by land three hundred and twenty-four
leagues, and converting to Christianity thirty-two
thousand souls.<a id='FA_XIV-19' href='#FN_XIV-19' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-19]</a>

<p>
At length we find on the Pacific seaboard a European
settlement, in the aboriginal fishing-station of
Panamá the germ of a Spanish city, the first on the
western side of the American continent from Patagonia
to Alaska, the first on the Isthmus which
remains to the present day. And there was much
about it which the befogged but in many respects far-seeing
adventurers of the time could foretell. There
was wealth on this shore, but to what extent they
knew not, as Peru stood yet unrevealed. Unless
some strait should be found, or some narrower thread
of Tierra Firme offering superior advantages, Panamá
would become the great entrepôt of South Sea traffic;
but wild as were their speculations in some respects,
in others the imagination was as far behind the facts.
Even in their wildest dreams they had not seen resting
on their broad-stretching beach ships from the
north and the south, and the far western east, laden
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_496' href='#Page_496'>496</a></span>
with the wealth of half a world, and in the streets of
their sun-beaten city gold and silver stacked in bricks;
and spices, and precious merchandise waiting transportation
over the cordillera to Nombre de Dios,
where cargoes of European goods in like manner waited
carriage southward.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SOUTH SEA METROPOLIS.</div>

<p>
To the importance of this city, even at this early
day, the Council of the Indies was by no means blind;
and beside the regulations<a id='FA_XV-1' href='#FN_XV-1' class='fnanchor'>[XV-1]</a> of a general nature regarding
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_497' href='#Page_497'>497</a></span>
settlement and city-building which began now to
be enacted, Panamá was the recipient of special royal
favors.
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_498' href='#Page_498'>498</a></span>
</p>

<p>
We have seen how Pedrarias, by fair means and
foul, labored to depopulate Antigua; and it was a
good work, though at the time he was not fully aware
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_499' href='#Page_499'>499</a></span>
of it. Fortune had favored him in many ways of
late, and the rewards of his rascalities were truly
gratifying. Not to mention the deaths of Vasco
Nuñez and Lope de Sosa, the successes of Espinosa
and other gold-hunting captains, or the discomfiture
of Gil Gonzalez, it was a fine stroke of policy making
the licenciado Alarconcillo his lieutenant at Antigua;
for the fraudulent residencias taken by him, under
the artful management of the governor's wife in
Spain, did Pedrarias and Espinosa good service at
court. Nor was there any practical inconvenience to
the governor in the royal orders prohibiting complex
legal proceedings, that the truth might be simply and
inexpensively arrived at in cases of dispute, and permitting
appeals from Castilla del Oro to the audiencia
of Santo Domingo; for the one gave his power a
wider range, while the other could be easily regulated
so as to work him no prejudice. Las Casas
likewise had failed in his effort to displace Pedrarias,
the privileges granted in Tierra Firme limiting
him to territory outside of the jurisdiction of this
governor.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">ABANDONMENT OF ANTIGUA.</div>

<p>
The abandonment of Antigua began in 1521, and
was consummated in September, 1524, Diego Ribero,
the last survivor, being massacred with his entire
family by his own Indians, who afterward burned
the town. Thus the streets wherein had been acted
so many stirring scenes were vacant, and the country,
after a struggle of fifteen years and the loss of
thousands of lives, lapsed into its original savagism.
By royal decree issued at Búrgos September 15, 1521,
Panamá was made a city, and received royal privileges
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_500' href='#Page_500'>500</a></span>
and a coat of arms, in further ennoblement.<a id='FA_XV-2' href='#FN_XV-2' class='fnanchor'>[XV-2]</a>
The regidores should enjoy the title of <i>veinticuatros</i>,
as in Seville and Córdova. For the first ten years the
city had to pay only a tithe on gold; the eleventh
year, one ninth; the twelfth, one eighth, and so on
to the fifteenth when the usual fifth would be due.
Hitherto the currency consisted of pieces of gold cut
into various weights; now silver and copper money
were employed.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">GOVERNMENT.</div>

<p>
The first regidores of Panamá were Gonzalo de
Badajoz, Rodrigo Enriquez de Colmenares, Rogel de
Loris, Pascual de Andagoya, Martin Estete, Benito
Hurtado, Luis de la Rocha, and Francisco Gonzalez.
The alcalde mayor, Hernando de Salaya, was made
lieutenant of Pedrarias in Panamá, with a salary of
150,000 maravedís, Espinosa having turned his attention
almost exclusively to military matters. The royal
officers formerly at Antigua as a rule held their places
in Panamá. These were Alonso de la Puente, the treasurer;
Diego Marquez, the contador; Miguel Juan de
Ribas, factor. To some of these Pedrarias was obliged
to give repartimientos as an inducement to move.
</p>

<p>
More difficulty was experienced in having the
episcopal see transferred to Panamá, but it was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_501' href='#Page_501'>501</a></span>
finally accomplished; the royal order to move it, with
the clergy and paraphernalia of the church as well
as the vecinos and the hospital, bearing date the
same as the order making Panamá a city, namely,
September 15, 1521. On the death of the first
bishop of Darien, Juan de Quevedo, a successor was
appointed in the person of Fray Vicente de Peraza.
Salaya and the Archdeacon Perez came out together
in 1522; Peraza came later, Salaya being commissioned
to superintend ecclesiastical affairs until the
bishop's arrival. And when he did arrive he appeared
in no haste to move, and was still at Antigua in
1524. There, finally, Pedrarias went and exercised
upon him his softest blandishments. The governor
could make himself quite pleasing to one who did not
know him. The bishop had not been long in Panamá
before his eyes were opened, and then, indeed, forever
closed; for one day, while the bishop and the governor
were at cards, they had a quarrel, during which the
latter was treated badly with words, and soon after
the bishop died. Then with Salaya the governor
employed sharp words, saying, if he did not mind he
would cut off his head. "More than one head you
have wrongfully cut off," Salaya retorted, "but he
who cuts off my head must have a better head than
mine, and that you have not." Then they were
friends again. Nevertheless Salaya died. Both these
men were poisoned; suspicion pointed to Pedrarias,
though he was never formally charged with the crime.
</p>

<p>
For the building of churches in Castilla del Oro,
the king gave large alms; his annual donation to the
hospital was three hundred pesos,<a id='FA_XV-3' href='#FN_XV-3' class='fnanchor'>[XV-3]</a> while the royal
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_502' href='#Page_502'>502</a></span>
treasury covered the cost of an organ and a clock
for the Panamá cathedral. About the time of the
removal, Francisco de Lizaur, procurador of the new
settlement for providing the Indians as well as the
Spaniards with food, procured an order requiring
the governor to attend to planting; likewise barter
must be opened with the natives, and negro slaves
were not allowed to accompany expeditions. The
boundaries of the municipality extended about forty-five
leagues in every direction from the three leagues
of city lands in the centre.
</p>

<p class="p2">
The natives of the New World, and they alone,
were expected to support the new city, and through
Panamá to send great wealth to Spain. The object
of the Spaniards was not agriculture, except to save
themselves from hunger; nor even mining, except as
they could force the natives to dig; it was unadulterated
robbery, with only the lame excuses of civilization
and Christianity, and Panamá was but a pirates'
nest.
</p>

<p>
By no means the worst of the band was Pascual de
Andagoya, who but for the bad company he kept
might have been pronounced an honest man. He
assisted Pedrarias, and acted as the forerunner of
Pizarro, but when it came to wholesale infamies he
had no zeal for them.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">EXPEDITION OF ANDAGOYA.</div>

<p>
A faithful retainer of the governor, he was in 1522
sent by him to explore the southern coast beyond the
limits of the discovery of Vasco Nuñez. Landing at
the gulf of San Miguel, Andagoya visited a province
called Chochama, where he was informed that during
the periods of the full moon, a fierce people infested
its shore, driving the inhabitants from their fisheries,
slaying them if they resisted, and spreading terror
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_503' href='#Page_503'>503</a></span>
generally. This people came from a province called
Birú, which name was corrupted by the Spaniards into
Pirú, and finally into the Peru of Francisco Pizarro.
Chochama begged Andagoya to protect his subjects
from this scourge, and having obtained reinforcements
from Panamá, Andagoya set out in company with his
host and his warriors for the dreaded region. Ascending
a large river for twenty leagues, the Spaniards
found a number of villages and caciques, and on the
outskirts of the province, near the junction of two
rivers, they discovered a strong native fortress, well
garrisoned, which on being attacked was defended
with skill and bravery. But superior tactics soon
prevailed, and after a struggle the stronghold was
reduced and the inmates were brought to terms.
</p>

<p>
The subjugation of Birú being thus effected, Andagoya
continued his voyage, the ships keeping well off
shore, while the commander reconnoitred the coast
in canoes navigated by friendly Indians. It happened
one day, while thus employed, that his boat was
caught in the surf and overturned. He was saved
by the brave efforts of one of the natives whose cause
he had espoused; but a rheumatic fever which followed
determined him to abandon the discovery,
and on the following day he turned his face toward
Panamá, where he arrived in safety with a few captives.<a id='FA_XV-4' href='#FN_XV-4' class='fnanchor'>[XV-4]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_504' href='#Page_504'>504</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Permission was then given to Juan Basurto to
continue the discovery of Andagoya; but his sudden
death cut short the preparations, and there the
matter rested until taken up by Francisco Pizarro.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">BRAVERY OF URRACÁ.</div>

<p class="p2">
Leaving for the moment affairs to the southward,
let us return to the western side of Panamá Bay.
There was a cacique named Urracá, whom the Spaniards
sought to kill, whose domain was the sierra of
Veragua, and whose crime was the love of liberty.
Indeed so villainously depraved was this savage that
he would not accept Spanish salvation and domination
when offered him in return for his gold; he even
thought to kill the good men who invaded his territory
to kill him. Urracá was fierce and strong; his
mountains were rugged, and his home almost inaccessible
to the hostile invader. Therefore he must be
approached with caution, and his capture intrusted
only to picked men. As he was reported rich, and
worth the trouble, two companies were fitted out
against him, one by water under Espinosa, and one
by land under Francisco Pizarro. The former embarked
at Panamá in two vessels, and, after touching
at the island of Cebaco, passed over to the mainland
of Veragua and began his march on the redoubtable
mountaineer. Urracá was not afraid of him, and
after placing the women, the children, and the aged
of his people in safety, with his warriors he marched
boldly out against the enemy. He first encountered
the Indian vanguard of Espinosa, and falling on them
slew them to a man. Then he fiercely attacked the
horsemen, of whom there were two or three, and the
foot-soldiers, fighting with such determination that
but for Hernando de Soto, who with thirty men
had been sent forward by Pizarro to seek a pass, the
licentiate would have been cut to pieces. Pizarro,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_505' href='#Page_505'>505</a></span>
who was near at hand, had not reached the place without
hard fighting. And now Urracá defied them all.
With every advantage of a rugged and well-known
country on his side, he rallied his men and attacked
the combined force with such desperate energy that
when night came the Spaniards endeavored to withdraw
secretly to the open plain. To this Urracá
objected. He permitted them to break up camp, it is
true, and to begin their march; but, when within
the darkest pass, he was on them again like a trap,
and from the black craggy defile they could not move,
except against the lances and war-clubs that hemmed
them in. With morning the question faced them,
whether they should die there or escape? And thus
the captains placed the matter before the men. Summoning
all their strength, they threw their united
force against the living obstructions at the opening
toward the sea, and, treading down the enemy, escaped
to their ships, and spreading sail directed their course
toward Panamá. But it would not do to return
empty-handed. So landing at Borrica they plundered
the town, and took the inhabitants captive, though
the licentiate finally released the women. While Espinosa
with the main body of his troops proceeded to
Natá, Francisco Compañon with fifty men surprised
by night a peaceful village in the neighborhood. It
was palisaded, and the Spaniards were repulsed. Hiding
themselves, they waited until the inhabitants had
come forth in the morning, and had scattered themselves
about the fields. At a signal they sprang upon
them. The poor natives ran for shelter from the
merciless steel, and arriving at the gateway in a body
they so blocked it as to be easily butchered. Those
not killed were carried captives to Natá.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">NATÁ AND CHIRIQUÍ.</div>

<p class="p2">
The native village of Natá was situated on an open
plain, most beautiful, with a fertile soil and wholesome
air. We have seen how on former occasions it
had attracted the attention of the Spaniards. They
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_506' href='#Page_506'>506</a></span>
had long desired to found there a settlement, and, the
present expedition having proved a failure, Espinosa
sent messengers to Pedrarias asking permission to
remain and form a colony. The governor acquiesced,
but ordered Espinosa with the ships to Panamá, leaving
at Natá only fifty men under Compañon.
</p>

<p>
The new seaport lay nearer to Urracá than the
island of Cebaco, although Espinosa began his march
against this province at a point on Azuero Peninsula,
opposite the island, more than thirty leagues from
Natá, by sea.
</p>

<p>
It was near enough, at all events, for the wary
Urracá to follow the Spaniards with his vindictive
eye. The chieftain, by his emissaries, knew when
Espinosa landed there, what he and the others did,
when they went away, and how many remained.
Peeping in on Compañon he thought he could manage
fifty men. He would try it. Collecting his forces he
made preparations to attack the Spaniards by night.
On approaching their quarters he came to a house at
some distance from the others, in which three men
were sleeping. One of them the savages killed with
a spear; one they captured; the third eluded them
until he had secured his arms, when he sprang up
and shouted as if to some companions near. Single-handed
he then attacked them and put them to flight;
after which he released his captive comrade, and the
two sought their commander. Compañon immediately
sent messengers to Pedrarias, informing him of
the attack.
</p>

<p>
It was not praiseworthy on the part of Urracá to allow
his multitude of brave warriors to be defeated by a
single Spaniard; probably he never knew how easily he
was beaten; and now confederating with his neighbors
he confined the Spaniards so closely in their quarters
that they began to suffer for food. The opportune arrival
of Hernando Ponce de Leon with forty men, and
shortly afterward of the governor himself with one
hundred and fifty men, placed Compañon at ease again.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_507' href='#Page_507'>507</a></span>
</p>

<p>
It is true; the old governor is in the field again!
War, at home or abroad, is his natural element. This
bold mountain chieftain must be put down; and who
so fitting to do it, who so capable, as the governor?
Appointing Francisco Pizarro as second in command,
with his entire available force, among which are some
horses and small cannon, Pedrarias sallies forth.
</p>

<p>
Urracá is ready to receive him. He has joined
forces with a neighbor named Exquegua, and awaits
the Spanish governor just beyond the strongest pass.
He hopes a second time to entangle the enemy
amongst the craggy steeps to him so familiar. The
fox enters the trap. The governor must choose
either to fight at great disadvantage, or retire and
leave the country to its aboriginal lord. Urracá
is powerful, sagacious, and brave. Occupying in his
retreat the most elevated part of the cordillera where
it cuts Veragua, and being about midway between the
two oceans, he can draw supplies and reinforcements
from either side. So pernicious is the influence he
exerts that he can prevent the pacification of western
Castilla del Oro: hence the importance of his
extermination.
</p>

<p>
The old governor harangues his army. After the
stale fashion of Xerxes and the Scipios he sneers at
the enemy, and praises his own men. It is not common
to hear Pedrarias praise any one. "You see the
necessity of this chieftain's death," he concludes; "let
it never be said of Spaniards that they left alive a
rich heathen." A charge is then ordered. The battle
lasts till nightfall. It is renewed the next day and
the day following. Before such unparalleled obstinacy
the Spaniards grow faint. Even the fire-belching cannon,
with its reverberating roar and its balls sweeping
down men, splitting rocks and trees, and tearing up
the earth, confounds them but for a moment. For
five days the engagement continues, much of the time
in a desultory manner, the Spaniards fighting from
under cover like the Indians.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_508' href='#Page_508'>508</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Urracá at length resorts to stratagem. Withdrawing
his forces as if in abandonment of the fight, he
retires toward the river Atra, the rendezvous of the
confederates from both sides of the cordillera. Pedrarias
follows, thinking in some open spot to scatter
the foe and kill them. Seeing which, Urracá calls to
him several wise warriors, and instructs them to play
the part of men of the country, and when captured by
the Spaniards to direct them to their ruin. Through
this ruse Diego de Albites falls into ambush, at one
time with forty men, at another with sixty, narrowly
escaping destruction.
</p>

<p>
Determined never to abandon the country until his
purpose is accomplished, Pedrarias sends out parties
against the villages of the confederates individually.
Two caciques, Bulaba and Musa, are captured, but on
accepting terms of peace are set at liberty. Urracá
avoids another general engagement, and Pedrarias returns
to Natá. The lands and captives are divided
among such soldiers as are willing to remain as colonists
under Diego de Albites, who is left there as
the governor's lieutenant. Sixty elect to remain, who
begin to build and plant. Thus is established the
town and settlement suggested by Espinosa, which
is called Natá after the cacique, and which name it
still retains, and next after Panamá on the Pacific
seaboard, Natá assumes importance as a Spanish settlement.
</p>

<p>
All the same it is exceedingly hard on the poor
aboriginal, drudgery or death. Those enslaved under
the fatherly-protection system endeavor by every
means to escape; failing in which, if they do not kill
themselves, they soon die from hard treatment. Urracá
never ceases narrowly to watch the Spaniards, attacking
them as opportunity offers. Albites retaliates with
frequent incursions; but unable to overthrow Urracá
he finally makes peace with him. This displeases
Pedrarias, who thereupon recalls Albites and appoints
Francisco Compañon governor of Natá. Under the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_509' href='#Page_509'>509</a></span>
new regime hostilities are yet more vigorously pressed,
but in almost every instance to the discomfiture of the
Spaniards.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Beyond the domain of Urracá, toward the west, in
Veragua, was the province of Chiriquí. Thither Pedrarias
sent Benito Hurtado to establish a colony.
The country being thinly populated was easily taken
and held. Indeed, the caciques of Chiriquí, Vareclas,
and Burica, the chief rulers within an area of one hundred
leagues, obeyed without resistance, and for two
years the colony of Chiriquí was unmolested. But
the more submissive the people, the more exacting the
conquering race. The crushing weight of servitude
becoming unbearable, the men of Chiriquí at length
rose to arms. They were joined in a general revolt
by Urracá. Unable to vanquish this chieftain, Compañon
determined to capture him by fair means or
foul. Overtures were begun by presents and fair
promises, and at length, under the most solemn assurances
of liberty and safety, Urracá was induced to
visit the governor at Natá. No sooner had he entered
the town than he was seized and ironed. I am
disposed to praise the perfidious Compañon for not
burning his captive, or giving him to the dogs; he only
sent him, in violation of his sacred pledge, a prisoner
to Nombre de Dios, with the intention of shipping
him off to Spain. Before the sailing of a ship, however,
the brave cacique managed to burst his fetters
and escape. Breathing vengeance he roused the
mountains, organized a yet more powerful confederation,
and marched against Natá. Long and bloody
warfare ensued, with alternate success. One of the
most disastrous conflicts occurred early in 1527, in an
expedition against a rebel chief named Trota, under
Captain Alonso de Vargas, with forty soldiers, principally
men newly arrived from Spain. The protestations
of some of Trota's adherents, who entered
the camp with humble mien but active eyes, induced
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_510' href='#Page_510'>510</a></span>
the captain, at the recommendation of a veteran
comrade, to send Pocoa, an allied chief and guide,
with offers of peace. The fellow was no sooner out
of sight than he cast the olive branch to the winds,
and joining cause with Trota, advised him to seize
so advantageous an opportunity for glory and revenge,
when the force before him was weak and inexperienced
and the commander ailing. Four days later
five hundred warriors fell upon the camp, led by
Pocoa in a glittering breastplate of gold. Although
taken by surprise, the soldiers fought desperately,
but the numbers were overwhelming, and Vargas
succumbed with half his men. This blow was one
more incentive for the Spaniards to exert themselves
in retaliation and conquest. The country adjacent
to the settlement being open and level, horses and
cannon could be used with advantage; while on the
other hand, to make up for lack of skill, were numbers,
drawn from a great distance around, with the protecting
mountains in which to nurse declining energies.
Thus for nine years the war continued, until
the chieftain Urracá, yielded up his life, though not,
after all, to arquebuse or bloodhound: he died in
bed, among his own people, but lamenting, with the
last breath, his inability to drive out the detested
Christians.

<p>
Scarcely were the fair provinces of the Southern
Sea brought under the yoke of the Spaniards, when
the conquerors began contending among themselves.
For it must be confessed that neither their culture
nor their religion prevented them from behaving very
much like the wild beasts and the wild men to whom
they regarded themselves superior. In following these
disputes we will now accompany, in a second visit to
Spain, the author and veedor, and withal the maker
of governors, Fernandez de Oviedo, whom we left in
July, 1523, fleeing the wrath of Pedrarias.
</p>

<p>
At Cuba the veedor was entertained by Diego
Velazquez, the governor; at Española he was invited
by Diego Colon to take passage with him for Seville,
where he arrived in November. After presenting
himself to the Council of the Indies, at Búrgos, he
went to Vitoria, where the court was residing. Vested
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_512' href='#Page_512'>512</a></span>
with full power to act for the city of Antigua, Oviedo
set forth the affairs of the colony, entered his complaints
against Pedrarias, and urged the appointment
of a new governor. In this measure he was opposed
by the bachiller Corral, whom he had made an effort
to send in chains to Spain, and by Isabel, wife of
Pedrarias. Through their influence he was involved
in litigation which lasted two years; and for his
treatment of the bachiller he was fined one hundred
thousand maravedís, which he was obliged to pay.
But in the end the veedor triumphed in displacing
Pedrarias, and in securing the appointment of Pedro
de los Rios, of Córdova, as governor of Castilla del
Oro, and of the licenciado Juan de Salmeron as alcalde
mayor and judge of residencia.
</p>

<p>
The prospect of speedy displacement in office, no
less than the success of Gil Gonzalez at the freshwater
sea, determined Pedrarias to secure a footing
in Nicaragua before the arrival of the new governor
of Castilla del Oro. No one knew better than himself
that by the customs of discovery and occupation,
which were now fast becoming laws, he had not the
slightest right there, having neither contributed to
the discovery of Gil Gonzalez, nor even sanctioned it.
As an act preliminary to taking possession of this
discovery, Pedrarias despatched thither his lieutenant,
Francisco Hernandez de Córdoba—not he who discovered
Yucatan, though of the same name—and
captains Gabriel de Rojas, Francisco Compañon, and
Hernando de Soto, who embarked from Panamá in
1524.

</div>

<div class="sidenote">CÓRDOBA IN NICARAGUA.</div>

<p>
Landing at the gulf of Nicoya Córdoba founded a
settlement at Urutina, on the east side, which he
called Brusélas, but which existed only three years,
being dismantled by order of Diego Lopez Salcedo in
1527. Thence Córdoba proceeded northward thirty
leagues, to Nequecheri, on the shore of Lake Nicaragua,
where he founded a city to which he gave the
name Granada, building there a fortress and a church.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_513' href='#Page_513'>513</a></span>
In the province of Nagrando<a id='FA_XVI-1' href='#FN_XVI-1' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-1]</a> he established another
city which he called Leon. While at Granada Córdoba
drew one of his brigantines ashore, and taking
it apart conveyed the pieces overland to Nicaragua
Lake. After rebuilding he made a circuit round the
shore of the Freshwater Sea, and discovered its outlet
in the Rio San Juan, though he did not descend the
stream, on account of the rocks and rapids. With
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_514' href='#Page_514'>514</a></span>
this leader had come many friars and religious men,
some of whom were quite expert in performing
miracles, and by this means was excited among the
natives a furor for baptism scarcely inferior to the
lively manifestation under the swift instructions of
Captain Gil Gonzalez. Córdoba sent Pedrarias a full
account of his proceedings thus far. He also informed
him that a band of Spaniards was lurking
thereabout, though as yet he had not encountered
them, but he had sent Hernando de Soto to learn
who they were.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">SPANISH COLONIAL SYSTEM.</div>

<p>
The colonial system of Spain as it unfolded in the
New World seemed at this time to assume the form
of a political tripod whose three props were the subjugator,
the sovereign, and the executive vicegerent,
each contributing to the support of the others, though
in a manner oppugnant and contradictory. It was
something wholly new in the polities of nations for
royalty thus to delegate so much and so varied
power at such a distance; and royalty was troubled
for itself in consequence, and regarded with jealousy
and mistrust such of its servants as it was obliged to
confide in. Ashamed of his suspicions, the sovereign
attempted to cover them by the application of chicane
to a system of balancing, placing one agent to
watch another, and counteracting the power of one
deputy by the power of another deputy. The discoverer
on returning from his perilous voyage must
wear away the remainder of his life importuning for
the promised recompense; and often he was compelled
to lose beside his services the costs advanced by
himself. The conqueror must be frowned upon in
the moment of his triumph, lest he should forget
himself, or rather forget his master. He, without
whose adventurings the monarch's realm could scarcely
find enlargement, must immediately on the attainment
of new territory be diverted by the intrusion
of some professional governor, who between law,
selfishness, and despotism usually managed to defeat
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_515' href='#Page_515'>515</a></span>
the aims of both king and conqueror, and attain his
own end in ruin and disgrace. Thus it was on Española,
and thus it is again on Tierra Firme. Had
Columbus been less incompetent as the beginner in
this colonization, and as governor; had he with wise
statesmanship founded one New World colony on firm
and liberal principles, the whole Spanish-American
colonial system during the following three centuries
might have been something quite different. Had the
monarch found on trial that his deputies were trustworthy,
he would have trusted them. Had he not,
they would have compelled him. As it was they compelled
him to treat them as unreliable and unjust, as
indeed they were, that is to say such of them as
were competent. While the monarch was far less
blamable than his representatives, while as a rule he
sought with honest and pious purpose the best welfare
of his subjects, civilized and savage, it seemed his
fate thus far to keep the colonies always in a ferment,
every man's hand against his neighbor, and under
such poisonous and perverting stimulus, that the vilest
elements attained success, while the noblest were
consumed to cinders. Witness Christopher Columbus
and Bartolomé his brother as against Bobadilla
and Ovando; Vasco Nuñez beside Pedrarias; and now
Pedrarias and Gil Gonzalez.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">GIL GONZALEZ AGAIN.</div>

<p class="p2">
Upon the return to Panamá in June, 1523, of
Andrés Niño and Gil Gonzalez, from their discovery
of Nicaragua, Pedrarias undertook, as we have seen,
at once to secure for himself every benefit of their
adventure. And this without a shadow of right or
reason. The pilot and the contador had acted under
authority direct from the king; they had imperilled
their lives and had exhausted their private fortunes;
while the governor had not only contributed nothing,
but actually disobeyed the king in refusing to deliver
the ships of Vasco Nuñez, and in withholding men
and means for the expedition. A grand achievement
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_516' href='#Page_516'>516</a></span>
had been consummated by a handful of men, poorly
equipped and in small unseaworthy vessels, whose consequent
sufferings were in a measure caused by the
inherent wickedness of the governor, now the first of
all to clutch at the gold. He would have the honor
of paying the king's fifth into the royal treasury, for
he could make it advantageous for himself.
</p>

<p>
Gil Gonzalez would cheerfully have turned over the
treasure to the king's officers, for his blood was up,
and he wished to return immediately and chastise the
impudent caciques, Diriangen and Nicaragua. But,
when under his letters patent he demanded aid for
that purpose, the governor promised it only on
condition that he went as his lieutenant, and that
the war should be conducted in his name. This the
contador refused to do. Pedrarias then said that he
would undertake the further pacification of Nicaragua
on his own account, and plant a colony, perhaps, at
the gulf of Fonseca; that a southern expedition which
he had planned would be directed north, in view
of the superior attractions appearing in the reports of
the late discoveries. Upon this Gil Gonzalez determined
to hasten from Panamá with the king's gold,
which had been melted down by the assayer, and lay
the matter before the audiencia at Santo Domingo,
thence going to Spain if necessary.
</p>

<p>
There was a caravel lying at Nombre de Dios,
which Gil Gonzalez purchased for one thousand castellanos,
and stealing from Panamá he escaped with
the gold, and set sail for Española just as Pedrarias
in hot pursuit appeared upon the shore with a requisition
and order of arrest.
</p>

<p>
The royal authorities at Santo Domingo listened
with favor to their former contador; on comparing
his actions with his instructions they found that he
had acquitted himself creditably. They deemed it
unnecessary for him to go to Spain, and thought he
could better serve the king by continuing his important
discovery. He might proceed at once to the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_517' href='#Page_517'>517</a></span>
eastern shore of Tierra Firme, and search for the
strait communicating with the Freshwater Sea, or its
outlet, which was sure to exist; or, failing in that,
enter the territory, pass over to the Freshwater Sea
by land, found there a colony and build a town. To
this end the audiencia promised to aid him in raising
three hundred men and fifty horses, which, with the
ship he had brought from Nombre de Dios, would
give him a fair equipment. Distributing, therefore,
the royal share of the treasure<a id='FA_XVI-2' href='#FN_XVI-2' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-2]</a> among five ships
lying at Santo Domingo, according to the royal regulations,
Gil Gonzalez despatched by Antonio de
Cereceda, treasurer of the Nicaraguan expedition,
the famous letter which I have so frequently quoted,
and a map of the coast from Panamá to the Gulf of
Fonseca, made with great care by the pilots of the
expedition. In this letter, after giving an account
of the discovery and presenting his plans, the writer
begs the sovereign that his pay as captain be made
over to his wife at Seville, for the support and education
of his children; that the limits of his discovery
may speedily be defined, and other conquerors and
rulers forbidden to intrude; that letters patent may
be granted him with the title of Admiral of the
Freshwater Sea, together with a tenth of the king's
revenue within the territory. Were it not that his
majesty might deem it a desire on the part of the
discoverer to call attention to himself he could tell
much more; but this he would say of five things
done by him, namely—no other Spaniard ever before
discovered so many leagues on foot with so few men
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_518' href='#Page_518'>518</a></span>
so poorly equipped; no man ever converted so many
souls to Christ in so short a time; no discoverer as
yet had brought so much gold; none had fought so
many Indians without the loss of a man; and, finally,
no one before him had ever returned from a voyage
of discovery without having lost to the adventurers
the cost of the outfit. Cereceda and the letter were
graciously received by the emperor, who ordered Gil
Gonzalez to continue his discoveries.

</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">ADMIRAL OF THE FRESHWATER SEA.</div>

<p>
But without waiting instructions from Spain Gil
Gonzalez had hastened to occupy what he had discovered,
before others should arrive to dispute possession
with him. He sailed from Santo Domingo in the
spring of 1524<a id='FA_XVI-3' href='#FN_XVI-3' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-3]</a> for the eastern coast of Nicaragua,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_519' href='#Page_519'>519</a></span>
intending to cross to the Freshwater Sea, by way of
its outlet, and thereby avoid collision with the governor
at Panamá; but he steered too far to the right,
and struck the continent on the north side of Honduras,
about twenty leagues east of Golfo Dulce.
Obliged by a storm to throw overboard some horses
to save his ship, he gave the name of Caballos<a id='FA_XVI-4' href='#FN_XVI-4' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-4]</a> to
the port from which he had under the circumstances
to turn away. From this point he was driven by the
wind westward to Golfo Dulce. Finding himself in
a strange mountainous country, and at a loss whither
to proceed, he deemed it safe in any event to take
possession and plant there a colony, and to this he
gave the name San Gil de Buenavista. Leaving
there a portion of his men he coasted eastward, to a
point between capes Honduras and Camarones, and
although still far from his destination he disembarked
the troops and marched southward in search of his
Freshwater Sea.
</p>

<p>
Continuing on this course Gil Gonzalez in due time
approached the territory of Nicaragua, but only to
encounter Hernando de Soto, sent by Córdoba to
ascertain who were the rival settlers. Gil Gonzalez
first learned of the presence of Córdoba in that
quarter while passing through the valley of Olancho.
There was but one way to settle rival claims under
such circumstances, the old brutal way, practised by
both savage and civilized from the beginning, and in
vogue to-day among our most Christian and cultured
nations—the weaker must give way to the stronger.
</p>

<p>
The two companies met at a place called Toreba.
The savage method of warfare was adopted. Just
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_520' href='#Page_520'>520</a></span>
before dawn, as Soto lay wrapped in slumber, Gil
Gonzalez, with a portion only of his command, crept
into the enemy's camp, and raising the war-cry, "San
Gil! kill the traitors!" began a furious onslaught upon
his countrymen. Soto commanded the superior force,
and although taken at a disadvantage he was soon
disputing for the victory with every prospect of success.
The engagement lasted some time, and several
Spaniards on both sides were killed. At length Gil
Gonzalez, fearing defeat, cried out, "Peace! peace,
Señor capitan, in the emperor's name!" And although
Soto was urged by his associates to follow up
the advantage, he ceased hostilities and prepared for
an amicable adjustment of differences.
</p>

<p>
Thus matters remained for several days. But Gil
Gonzalez had no intention of abandoning the field, as
his actions and words implied. He only wished to
gain time and bring up the remainder of his force.
This effected, he again suddenly sprang upon the
enemy, and after a short but severe engagement
drove him from the field, securing his treasure, to
the value of one hundred and thirty thousand castellanos.<a id='FA_XVI-5' href='#FN_XVI-5' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-5]</a>
</p>

<p>
Satisfied with this success, and unprepared to meet
a superior force under Córdoba, Gil Gonzalez disarmed
the enemy, and retired to Puerto Caballos, where he
was informed that a fleet had arrived from Mexico in
command of Cristóbal de Olid, one of the captains of
Hernan Cortés.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">HONDURAS AND NICARAGUA.</div>

<p class="p2">
After the defeat of Soto, Córdoba took measures
to strengthen his position at Leon, building there a
strong fortress. Cristóbal de Olid, of whom I shall
speak presently, founded a settlement on the north
coast of Honduras, fourteen leagues east of Puerto
Caballos, to which he gave the name of Triunfo de la
Cruz.<a id='FA_XVI-6' href='#FN_XVI-6' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-6]</a> Thus for the territory now embraced within
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_521' href='#Page_521'>521</a></span>
the boundaries of Nicaragua and Honduras, there
appeared three claimants—Gil Gonzalez, who, under
the auspices of the crown, claimed for himself as the
discoverer; Francisco Hernandez de Córdoba, who
claimed for Pedrarias; and Cristóbal de Olid, who
claimed for Cortés and himself.

</p>

<p>
While certain of the Spaniards were settling
themselves in possession of the Isthmus and parts of
Central America, others were engaged in like manner
elsewhere. Among the latter was Hernan Cortés,
who sailed from Cuba, in 1519, for the conquest of
Mexico, which was accomplished in 1521. So great
was the glory of this achievement, complete details
of which will be given in a later volume of this
work, that fresh hordes flocked to the banner of
its hero, whose further efforts toward conquest in
different directions were little more than triumphal
marches. On nearly every side his captains found
rich provinces and populous settlements which promised
flattering rewards in tributes, plantations, and
submissive slaves; or their ears were filled with
reports of still greater cities, still richer territories,
further on. From such substance rumor blew its
gaudy bubbles, which danced in iridescent hues and
ever increasing size before the eyes of the conquerors,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_523' href='#Page_523'>523</a></span>
luring them on into the depths of mysterious regions
beyond. Insatiate, a world apiece would scarcely
satisfy them now.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">OUTLOOK FROM MEXICO.</div>

<p>
Of the several points toward which expeditions
were sent out from the Mexican capital by its conqueror,
the southern regions seemed in some respects
the most alluring. Information came to Cortés of
the high culture of the inhabitants in that quarter,
of their manifold wealth, their palaces and great cities,
all magnified by mystery and distance. Further than
this, the possibility, nay, the certainty that Spaniards
moving northward from the Panamá region
would soon be in possession there if not forestalled,
made delay seem dangerous. Hence it was that
Oajaca and Chiapas were quickly made to open
their portals; and now the redoubtable Pedro de
Alvarado, second only to Cortés himself, was entering
Tehuantepec to rend the veil which enfolded the
Quiché kingdom, and to disclose the splendor of
Utatlan.
</p>

<p>
Likewise the northern seaboard to the south of
Yucatan claimed attention. This could scarcely now
be called an undiscovered country, for Spaniards as
well as natives poured into the conqueror's ears the
sure truth of what might be expected. There were
pilots whose course had led them along the coast of
Hibueras, or Honduras,<a id='FA_XVII-1' href='#FN_XVII-1' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-1]</a> and who charmed their
hearers with tales of gold so abundant that fishermen
used nuggets for sinkers. In this there was nothing
startling to Cortés, however, for since his first entry
into Mexico he had received such information touching
this Honduras country, particularly two provinces,
that were but one third true, "they would far exceed
Mexico in wealth, and equal her in the size of towns,
in the number of inhabitants, and in culture."<a id='FA_XVII-2' href='#FN_XVII-2' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-2]</a>
</p>

<p>
These reports could not be disregarded. An expedition
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_524' href='#Page_524'>524</a></span>
to this region would also be able to meet that
of Alvarado, and crowned with success the two could
then carry conquest onward, till sullen ocean, east,
and west, and south, alone might bar the progress
of their arms. Great would be also the reward in
wealth and souls. Another wish, the discovery of a
strait, ruled Cortés with equal strength. It was now
known how short a distance lay between the two
oceans, and this long narrow strip of intervening
land might in some one of its many inlets hide the
passage, though it was toward the north that the
conquistador looked chiefly for it. The subject had
been specially commended to him by the emperor.
"Knowing the desire of your Majesty," writes Cortés,
"to discover the secret of this strait, and the great
benefit which your royal crown will derive therefrom,
I shall leave all other interests and gains to follow
this course."<a id='FA_XVII-3' href='#FN_XVII-3' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-3]</a> As an earnest of his intention Cortés
had begun to build vessels at Zacatula, on the South
Sea, as early as 1522, and with these he would explore
the coast northward till the passage was found, or
proved not to exist. In the North Sea also fleets
were prepared to coast northward to Newfoundland,
and southward to the Isthmus.
</p>

<p>
The expeditions were all delayed, the first by conflagration,
the others by incidents at Pánuco which for
a time diverted all available forces. The latter difficulty
over, Cortés reverted to his pet project, and the
Atlantic fleet, which had been for several months at
considerable expense waiting orders for sailing south,
was now reinforced to muster six vessels fully equipped,
with nearly four hundred Spaniards and thirty horses.<a id='FA_XVII-4' href='#FN_XVII-4' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-4]</a>
</p>

<p class="p2">
So important an expedition called for a lieutenant
not only brave and able, but trustworthy. Amongst
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_525' href='#Page_525'>525</a></span>
the three or four thus esteemed by the great conqueror
was Cristóbal de Olid,<a id='FA_XVII-5' href='#FN_XVII-5' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-5]</a> before mentioned, who, owing
to his prominent position under Governor Velazquez
of Cuba, had been appointed captain under Cortés
when he set out for the subjugation of Montezuma's
empire. His devotion, courage, and ability had made
him a favorite, and at the fall of Mexico he had been
rewarded with an ample share of the treasures and
encomiendas. While lacking in sincerity and depth
of thought, and being less fit for the council, he possessed
qualities which made him an admirable executive
officer. He was at this time about thirty-seven,
of powerful physique and stentorian voice, which contributed
not a little to his success as a leader.<a id='FA_XVII-6' href='#FN_XVII-6' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-6]</a>
</p>

<p>
Several of the old campaigners, but lately ensconced
in snug plantations where they were enjoying a post-bellum
repose, were called to aid Olid. This they did,
though not always consenting with cheerful faces.
Among the number was Captain Briones, a turbulent
fellow, who had brought some scars from the wars in
Italy, and, after airing his profane vocabulary as commander
of brigantines during the siege of Mexico, had
nursed a hatred against Cortés for services that he
fancied to have been ill paid.<a id='FA_XVII-7' href='#FN_XVII-7' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-7]</a> Two priests were added
to the expedition.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEPARTURE OF OLID.</div>

<p>
Olid was instructed to direct his course to Cape
Hibueras, and after founding a fortified settlement to
despatch the three largest vessels to Cuba for supplies,
while the three smaller, under command of Hurtado
de Mendoza, the cousin of Cortés, were to search for
a strait as far as Darien, exploring first the gulf thereabout,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_526' href='#Page_526'>526</a></span>
that is the Bahía de la Ascension, as the instructions
read, from which "many pilots believe a
strait to lead into the other sea." The fleet left San
Juan de Chalchiuhcuecan, the present Vera Cruz, January
11, 1524, for Habana, where an agent of Cortés
was then purchasing additional arms, horses, and stores
for Olid.<a id='FA_XVII-8' href='#FN_XVII-8' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-8]</a>
</p>

<p class="p2">
Let traitors beware of treachery. Cortés had been
untrue to Governor Velazquez: by what law of compensation
could he expect subordinates to be true to him?
Scarcely was the fleet adrift before Briones was whispering
his commander treason. And when on landing
at Habana the Cuban governor, with all the hatred of
foiled ambition, joined the foes of Cortés to work upon
the fidelity of his captain, Olid was shaken. "Mexico
by right is mine," argued the governor. "It is I who
am your rightful chief, and I absolve you from the
miscreant you follow. Strike out from him, as did he
from me; I will furnish men and money, and the king
shall know of your conduct and reward it."<a id='FA_XVII-9' href='#FN_XVII-9' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-9]</a>

<p>
Ere the fleet left Cuba Olid had decided on his
course. He had learned prudence, however, under
his wily chief, and resolved to do nothing decisive,
until he found himself strong enough, and had learned
whether the country was worth the risk.<a id='FA_XVII-10' href='#FN_XVII-10' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-10]</a> On landing,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_527' href='#Page_527'>527</a></span>
therefore, some fourteen leagues east of Caballos,
the 3d of May, he not only took possession in the
name of Cortés, but appointed the officials named by
him. The papers of possession, however, bore Olid's
name.<a id='FA_XVII-11' href='#FN_XVII-11' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-11]</a> To the town here founded was given the
name of Triunfo de la Cruz, from the day of landing.<a id='FA_XVII-12' href='#FN_XVII-12' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-12]</a>
</p>

<p>
Olid was not long in openly declaring his intentions.
Most of his company acquiesced; a few did
not. These latter to the number of three score, under
an officer named Valenzuela, after robbing the
town during the absence of the men in the interior,
seized one of the vessels and set sail for Mexico, but
only to meet shipwreck and starvation at Cozumel
Island.<a id='FA_XVII-13' href='#FN_XVII-13' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-13]</a> All thoughts of searching for a strait had
been abandoned, and Olid determined to hasten forward,
make himself acquainted with the country,
and secure possession. It was not many days before
he came upon the bands of Spaniards whom we have
seen there fighting each other, and Olid's presence
among them tended in no wise to lessen complications.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">GIL GONZALEZ AND OLID.</div>

<p class="p2">
Gil Gonzalez was not in condition to meet so powerful
an opponent as Olid, especially with a threatening
avenger in the near west; and so he thought it
prudent to retire until he might secure to his own
interests at least one side by an alliance. Nor was
Olid just then strong enough openly to brave a well
known Spanish leader. He therefore met the advances
made him by Gil Gonzalez in a friendly spirit,
and sought by artful letters to lull suspicions regarding
his true motives.
</p>

<p>
Surely they were not in vain, the lessons he had
learned under the astute Cortés. Watching an opportunity,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_528' href='#Page_528'>528</a></span>
when Gil Gonzalez had confidingly divided
his forces, he sent Briones, his maestre de campo, to
surprise them in detail, while he himself prepared
with another body to descend in two caravels on the
coast settlements. Early next morning, as Olid awoke
pluming himself over his well laid plans, a page
rushed in, announcing, "Two sails in the offing, señor
capitan!" Olid hastened to the shore not without
misgivings that this might be a Mexican expedition,
bearing perhaps his injured chief.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">CASAS SENT AFTER OLID.</div>

<p class="p2">
It so happened that while the renegade Olid was at
Habana, the royal factor, Salazar, had arrived there
en route for Mexico to assume office, and learned only
too clearly what was brewing. Nor was he the only
one to carry the news. Cortés heard it with distended
nostrils, and the characteristic swelling of his
veins<a id='FA_XVII-14' href='#FN_XVII-14' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-14]</a> indicated the anger which the next moment
found utterance. "Villain! whom I have reared, and
honored, and trusted; by God and St Peter he shall
rue it!"<a id='FA_XVII-15' href='#FN_XVII-15' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-15]</a> Unable to enter in person upon the determined
chastisement, the general sent Francisco de las
Casas, a resolute man of no mean ability, married to
a cousin-german<a id='FA_XVII-16' href='#FN_XVII-16' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-16]</a> of his, and therefore regarded with
greater confidence. He relied also on the many warm
adherents in the rebel camp who could require no
very strong appeal to return to their leader. For
this reason four vessels, two of them quite small,<a id='FA_XVII-17' href='#FN_XVII-17' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-17]</a> and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_529' href='#Page_529'>529</a></span>
one hundred and fifty men were deemed a sufficient
force to subjugate the usurper.
</p>

<p>
As the fleet approached Triunfo a boatman was
captured who gave information of the state of affairs,
and on entering the harbor Casas hoisted a flag of
peace with the hope that friendly overtures might
bring about a revolution of sentiment, among a portion
of the rebels, in favor of his chief. Olid, however,
who had at once suspected the character of the arrival,
knew the danger of a parley, particularly since
the greater part of his force was absent. Brave and
resolute, he ordered his two caravels to be manned,
and opened fire to prevent a landing. Finding his
overtures disregarded Casas replied with equal spirit,
covering at the same time the operations of the boats
which he sent off. It was an original spectacle in
these parts, Spaniards fighting Spaniards, in regular
naval engagement; and as the hissing projectiles flew
out from the smoke over the still waters, followed
now and then by a crash, the noise of battle reverberating
over the forest-clad hills, the dusky spectators
who lined the shore should have been exceedingly
grateful for this free exhibition of the wisdom and
power of European civilization that had come so far
to instruct them in such a fashion.<a id='FA_XVII-18' href='#FN_XVII-18' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-18]</a> Presently,
amidst the boom of cannon and dimly belching flames,
cries of distress were heard, followed not long after
by shouts of victory. Olid's gunners had found their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_530' href='#Page_530'>530</a></span>
match. One of his caravels was sinking, and the
attacking boats were approaching the second. Hurriedly
sounding the recall he sought the shore, with
the loss of a few men,<a id='FA_XVII-19' href='#FN_XVII-19' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-19]</a> sending meanwhile a boat to
the victor with a proposal for truce, on condition that
no landing should be effected till the negotiations for
surrender were completed. Casas consents; and Ares
dons the mask of Pallas. The first act of Olid
on sighting the fleet had been to despatch a messenger
to his lieutenant Briones, summoning him in
all haste to his assistance. Time might now be
gained by parley. But to the same lieutenant went
another messenger from Casas with the most alluring
promises for active or passive aid. And in this
Casas was so far successful that Olid waited in vain
for succor, while his opponent, under further prospect
of support in the camp itself, lay confidently at
anchor waiting the dawn.<a id='FA_XVII-20' href='#FN_XVII-20' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-20]</a>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">OLID CAPTURES HIS ENEMIES.</div>

<p>
It was a golden chain of treachery thus lengthening
itself from the capital of the Indies through
Mexico and into the wilderness of Central America;
Velazquez revolts from Diego Colon, Cortés from
Velazquez, Olid from Cortés, and Briones from Olid.
But what avails the cunning of man against the gods!
That night a storm burst upon the harbor, and within
an hour the late victor found himself, with the loss of
his vessels and some forty men, upon the shore swearing
allegiance to the enemy.<a id='FA_XVII-21' href='#FN_XVII-21' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-21]</a> Buffeted to exhaustion
by the waves, and without arms, Casas was thus
fished in by the exultant Olid.
</p>

<p>
The next step was to secure the fleeing Gil Gonzalez,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_531' href='#Page_531'>531</a></span>
who was surprised at Choloma and brought
to headquarters,<a id='FA_XVII-22' href='#FN_XVII-22' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-22]</a> which had meanwhile been removed
to Naco, a fertile and salubrious valley about twenty
leagues from Caballos, occupying a central position
and abundantly supplied with means of subsistence.
</p>

<p>
Olid was a generous jailer. He was haunted by
none of the suspicious fear which resorted to manacles
and shackles. Casas and Gil Gonzalez were
treated rather as guests than as prisoners; they were
given seats at Olid's own table, and allowed to share
in every conviviality. They enjoyed in fact every
liberty, except that of crossing the limit fixed for
their movements. Finding the host so lenient Casas
began to plead also for release. He wished to present
himself before Cortés and justify his conduct.
Olid of course would not consent. "You are too
pleasant a companion for me to lose," he smilingly
said to his captive. "Ah, well! your worship," Casas
replied, "pray God I prove not so pleasant as
some day to kill you." The prisoners had not failed
to improve the opportunities which their trusting
host provided, and finding that Briones held out as a
rebel, they gained sufficient confidence to form a conspiracy.
On a certain evening seats at table were
secured for two accomplices, while near at hand were
others awaiting the appointed signal. Ever a most
agreeable companion, on this occasion Casas outdid
himself; and had not Olid been of so unsuspecting a
nature he would have seen through the veil of affectation
that enveloped the conversation. When the
table was cleared and the attendants had withdrawn,
the conspirators exchanged glances; whereupon one
of them, Juan Nuñez de Mercado, passed behind
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_532' href='#Page_532'>532</a></span>
Olid, and seizing his head pulled it back, while
Casas, who was seated beside him, rose and grasping
him by the beard, began to slash at his throat with a
pocket knife,<a id='FA_XVII-23' href='#FN_XVII-23' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-23]</a> crying, "Tyrant! the earth shall no
longer endure thee." Gil Gonzalez was instantly on
the other side of Olid stabbing him in the breast.
Yet with all their advantage they made slovenly
work of it, cutting up the old hero. He was a
powerful man, and in a moment had recovered himself
and was hurling his assailants right and left. He
called to his guard, but these were quickly secured
by the conspirators. Olid made his escape, however,
and sought a thicket where he fell, fainting from loss
of blood. The conspirators shouted lustily, affirming
that he was dead, and called on all present, in the
name of the emperor and of Cortés, to rally round
Casas.<a id='FA_XVII-24' href='#FN_XVII-24' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-24]</a> None cared to refuse.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE DEATH OF OLID.</div>

<p>
Meanwhile Cristóbal de Olid, one of the proudest
of Mexico's proud conquerors, felt that the knives of
these assassins had been too much for him. He who
had so many times faced death for mighty cause
must now die of dastardly blows inflicted by countrymen.
True, he was a rebel. But so was his master.
And who of those present would not cast off any
allegiance the moment their interests demanded it?
The cold grasp of death was on him. Of what avail
at this moment were the hardships endured, and the
infamies so lately inflicted in the crushing of Montezuma
and his people? Crawling to an Indian hut he
begged shelter and secrecy, offering all his wealth for
these favors, and for yet another, that a priest should
be summoned. How many of this race had begged
of him, and begged in vain! The owner of the hut
went out upon his mission. It was almost impossible
that the dying conquistador should not thereby be
discovered, but to die unshriven was death thrice
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_533' href='#Page_533'>533</a></span>
over. Closely upon the priest's heels like thirsting
bloodhounds followed the assassins, who, now
that their noble quarry was stricken, plucked up the
courage to cut off his head by law. Dragging forth
the dying man, a court was formed, which that night
declared him traitor, and doomed him to death. As
if to favor them, life lingered with the prisoner until
morning, when he was brought into the plaza, his eyes
half closed in death, to receive his sentence. There
and then the hideous mockery was completed; and as
the head was severed not one voice was heard, not
one hand moved in sympathy for the gallant soldier
who had so often led his men to victory, and whose
hand had been as free to give as was his voice to
cheer.<a id='FA_XVII-25' href='#FN_XVII-25' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-25]</a>
</p>

<p>
Being now master of the situation, Casas made
some necessary changes among the officials to insure
the fruits of victory. Triunfo having proved unsafe,
it was decided to form a settlement in a more secure
harbor. Nearly four score enrolled themselves as
settlers and a municipality was appointed, with the
recommendation to select a site at Puerto de Caballos,
if found suitable, and to name the town Trujillo,
after the native town of Casas.<a id='FA_XVII-26' href='#FN_XVII-26' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-26]</a> Eager to relieve
the anxiety of Cortés and to consult with him, Casas
did not stay to see this carried out, but selecting
Juan Lopez de Aguirre, originally treasurer, as his
lieutenant, aided by the new alcaldes, Mendoza and
Medina, the latter also contador, he set out on his
return to Mexico. A large number accompanied him,
leaving but a little more than a hundred adherents of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_534' href='#Page_534'>534</a></span>
Cortés in the province.<a id='FA_XVII-27' href='#FN_XVII-27' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-27]</a> Among those who went
was Gil Gonzalez, too dangerous a man to leave behind,
who must appear before Cortés and arrange
with him as to what share in the province he might
keep, if any. Meanwhile his men appear to have
been left in possession of the Nito district.<a id='FA_XVII-28' href='#FN_XVII-28' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-28]</a> The
route taken led through Guatemala, the later highway
to Mexico. On the road they came upon Briones,
who fancied that his desertion of Olid entitled him to
consideration on the part of Olid's enemy. But nobody
liked the man, and regarding him, furthermore,
as dangerous to the peace of Honduras, they took the
precaution of hanging him.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Lieutenant Aguirre conducted his party to Caballos,
as instructed, but the site did not meet with
general approval, and a vessel arriving with a glowing
description of Puerto de Honduras, it was decided
to go there. The vessel was chartered and Aguirre
went on board with nearly forty men, a number of
native servants, and the stores and other articles
which the party proceeding by land could not conveniently
carry. When the land expedition reached
the port no vessel was there. An anxious search
being instituted for the possible evidence of a shipwreck,
an inscription by Aguirre was found bidding
the men not to grieve; he had sailed on for supplies
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_535' href='#Page_535'>535</a></span>
and would soon return. The mockery of this message
was only too apparent, and bitterly did they
denounce the deserters who had carried off not
only treasure and effects, but abandoned them on a
strange shore with but scanty armament. The horses
were now their main reliance. Although poorly provided
they remained, and electing Alcalde Medina to
the captaincy, proceeded on May 18, 1525, to found
Trujillo and install officers.<a id='FA_XVII-29' href='#FN_XVII-29' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-29]</a>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SANTO DOMINGO AUTHORITIES.</div>

<p>
One morning, not long after, a caravel was seen
approaching, and eagerly the officials set out to meet
her. But it was not theirs. The audiencia of Santo
Domingo had heard of the threatened collision of
rival factions in Honduras, and of the fuel Casas was
bringing to the flame. They were desirous that their
authority should be felt in these parts. They would
bend the spirit of these turbulent governors. On
this occasion Fiscal Pedro Moreno, a better trader
than judge, had been sent by the grand tribunal to
Honduras to order away Casas, to enjoin Córdoba
and Alvarado not to meddle, to impose on Olid and
Gil Gonzalez the authority of the audiencia, with
injunctions to peaceably occupy only that part of
which they had been the first to take possession, and
to surrender to the fiscal the royal fifth. To cover
the expenses of the commission the chartered caravel
had been loaded, for account of the crown, with
arms and stores, which were to be distributed among
the needy colonists at a profit. If the adventure
proved successful the judges might make a part of
the profit their own; if unfortunate, who so well
fitted to bear the loss as the sovereign!
</p>

<p>
Medina related to Moreno the troubles of the
colonists, including the desertion of Aguirre, and appealed
to him for redress. He also asked for arms.
Moreno offered to relieve the wants of the colony
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_536' href='#Page_536'>536</a></span>
only on condition that it should transfer allegiance
from Cortés to the audiencia, as agents for the emperor,
and accept for captain Juan Ruano, one of
Olid's officers, as had been done by Gil Gonzalez'
men.<a id='FA_XVII-30' href='#FN_XVII-30' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-30]</a> Pressed by necessity the colonists acquiesced.
One of the first acts in connection with the transfer
was to change the name Trujillo to Ascension. After
a kidnapping raid on a neighboring pueblo, Moreno
departed with about forty slaves, promising soon to
return with a force strong enough to hold the province.<a id='FA_XVII-31' href='#FN_XVII-31' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-31]</a>
Hardly had his sails disappeared when the
colonists restored the standard of Cortés, and sent
Ruano to follow his patron, with the reminder that
his moderation and efforts in their behalf had alone
saved his neck.

<span class="subhead">MARCH OF CORTÉS TO HONDURAS.
<br />
1524-1525.

</p>

<p>
Inordinate covetings had never been characteristic
of Cortés; but when a man attains eminence in
wealth, power, or fame, it seems natural, it is rather
expected, that he should become sordid, grasping,
callous to human sympathy, indifferent to noble
sentiment, the slave of avarice and ambition. Greed
constitutes no small part of grandeur.
</p>

<p>
Northward from the Mexican capital were limitless
lands; Cortés could not tell how much there
might be to the west; hence one would think he
might well leave to his countrymen in the south
something for their pains; that he might even give
his captains independent governments without diminution
of his manliness.
</p>

<p>
But insignificant to Cortés as was this Honduras
country, and petty as were the bickerings of its occupants,
they were nevertheless objects of solicitude
to the great chief. No sooner had Casas left the
Chalchiuhcuecan shore, than Cortés began to doubt
the wisdom of his course in sending one servant after
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_538' href='#Page_538'>538</a></span>
another. The more he reflected on the popularity of
Olid and the number of his men, the comparatively
untried ability of his opponent, and the reputed
wealth of the country, the more he feared for the
result, and wished to be present there in person.<a id='FA_XVIII-1' href='#FN_XVIII-1' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-1]</a>
Not to mention the itching palm for power, this
desire was increased by the petty espionage to which
the imperial officers subjected his every movement.
He longed to roam with kindred spirits in the wilds
of the south, wherein native tradition located stately
cities and treasure-filled palaces. He longed to meet
a worthy foe. As he nursed the dream, the glow
increased within him at the prospect of penetrating
unknown regions, overcoming toil and danger, and
discovering something new, something startling; perchance
he might find the long-sought strait.
</p>

<p>
A hint in this direction was sufficient to rouse the
anxiety of friends and enemies alike. He was the
guiding spirit of all undertakings, and the protecting
shield. All would return to chaos were he to withdraw;
and the still wavering natives who respected
and feared Malinche, as Cortés was called by the
Mexicans, above any host of soldiers, might rise and
overwhelm them.
</p>

<p>
So urgent and general were the representations
to this effect that he yielded, or pretended to yield.<a id='FA_XVIII-2' href='#FN_XVIII-2' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-2]</a>
But the spirit of the Castilian explorer once aroused
could not be repressed. He felt that he had been
too long idle, so he wrote his sovereign, and must do
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_539' href='#Page_539'>539</a></span>
something in the service of his Majesty.<a id='FA_XVIII-3' href='#FN_XVIII-3' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-3]</a> Preparations
were accordingly resumed under pretence that a
disaffection in the Goazacoalco region required his
personal attention.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">PERSONNEL OF THE ARMY.</div>

<p class="p2">
He set out from Mexico in the latter part of October,
1524,<a id='FA_XVIII-4' href='#FN_XVIII-4' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-4]</a> leaving the government in charge of men
whose flattery had blinded him to their insidious
designs. The party consisted of about one hundred
horsemen, half of them with extra animals, some forty
archers and arquebusiers, and three thousand native
warriors and servants,<a id='FA_XVIII-5' href='#FN_XVIII-5' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-5]</a> the latter chiefly under the
leadership of the three deposed sovereigns, Quauhtemotzin
the last emperor of Mexico, Tetlepanquetzal
king of Tlacopan, and Cohuanococh king of Tezcuco,
and five or six captive caciques, whom it was regarded
unsafe to leave behind.<a id='FA_XVIII-6' href='#FN_XVIII-6' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-6]</a>
</p>

<p>
Among the leading officers in the train were the
alguacil mayor, Sandoval, Ocampo, Ircio, Saavedra,
Grado, and a number who acted as household officials
and gentlemen in waiting to the leader. There were
also a retinue of pages, youths of good family, among
them young Montejo, later conqueror of Yucatan,
and a number of musicians, jugglers, tumblers, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_540' href='#Page_540'>540</a></span>
clowns.<a id='FA_XVIII-7' href='#FN_XVIII-7' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-7]</a> Cortés had a natural bent for pomp, the
pomp that gracefully adorns the truly great. The
church was represented by a clergyman and three
friars; chief among interpreters was Marina, the
Mexican maiden, whose clear head and devoted heart
had more than once saved the Castilian invaders, and
preserved their leader to her love.
</p>

<p>
The march was directed to Espíritu Santo, the
place of review, not far above the mouth of the
Goazacoalco. On the way the party was made the
object of a series of demonstrations, and the settlers
of Goazacoalco, including the 'true historian,' Bernal
Diaz, came forth in procession, with fireworks and
masquerade, to conduct the mighty conqueror under
triumphal arches and amid salvos to his quarters.
The joy was mingled with misgivings, however, for
the small force and still smaller equipment awakened
a fear that a levy might be made. This proved only
too true, and while some joined of their own will,
dazzled by the lustre of the leader's name, others,
happy with a repartimiento of Indians, who existed
only to attend their wants, were not so quick to fall
into line.<a id='FA_XVIII-8' href='#FN_XVIII-8' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-8]</a> The chiefs of the neighborhood were
summoned to give information, and showed a surprising
acquaintance with the country as far south even
as the domain of Pedrarias. They also prepared a
map on cloth, depicting minutely the different rivers,
mountains, and pueblos on the route to Nito,<a id='FA_XVIII-9' href='#FN_XVIII-9' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-9]</a> some
of them ravaged by Spaniards, and now deserted.
The manuscript representation of this vast region,
filled with great cities and rich provinces, determined
Cortés to advance toward Honduras direct, and abandon
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_541' href='#Page_541'>541</a></span>
the idea once entertained of going through Guatemala.<a id='FA_XVIII-10' href='#FN_XVIII-10' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-10]</a>
Both the map and the imagination failed,
however, adequately to picture the vast morasses
and miry sloughs alternating with and bordering the
countless rivers which served for highways to the
natives. The lithe, unencumbered Indian could not
clearly grasp the difficulties herein presented to the
heavy cavalry, for in his light canoe he could speed
along the mighty streams, pass up the tributary
branches, and penetrate far and wide by means of
the more shallow creeks into the primeval forests.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">A GAY COMPANY.</div>

<p>
After a week's stay the expedition advanced. Tumbler
and fiddler led in the van a merry dance, perhaps
to death; in the rear was a herd of swine, kept at
a safe distance, however, lest its presence should too
greatly tempt the appetite of the hungry soldiers.
The artillery of four guns, a quantity of small arms,
ammunition, and stores were sent by a vessel to Rio
Tabasco, to be followed by two small caravels from
Medellin laden with provisions. From this point it
was intended to let one of them follow the coast, west
of Yucatan, still regarded as an island, so as to be
able to furnish supplies when called upon by the land
force which also expected to follow the shore. The
rainy season was not yet over, and the very brooks
had swollen into rushing rivers. Two streams, nine
and eighteen leagues respectively from Espíritu Santo,
had to be crossed in canoes, the horses swimming,<a id='FA_XVIII-11' href='#FN_XVIII-11' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-11]</a>
and beyond flowed a still wider watercourse which
required a bridge of nine hundred and thirty-four
paces in length. The difficulties of the march may
be understood from the statement that while traversing
Copilco province, fully fifty bridges had to be constructed
within a distance of twenty leagues.<a id='FA_XVIII-12' href='#FN_XVIII-12' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-12]</a> It
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_542' href='#Page_542'>542</a></span>
was a rich department with half a score of head
pueblos, and having an abundance of provisions they
were ordered to send tribute in kind to Espíritu
Santo. After crossing a steep range a wide tributary
of Rio Tabasco was reached,<a id='FA_XVIII-13' href='#FN_XVIII-13' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-13]</a> where the troops were
cheered by the arrival of a score of canoes laden
with provisions from one of the vessels. Natives of
the province also appeared in obedience to a summons,
and assisted in crossing the river and in opening
a path along the thickly wooded bank to the
capital of Cihuatlan<a id='FA_XVIII-14' href='#FN_XVIII-14' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-14]</a> province, twelve leagues up
the river. As they approached it the guides and
sappers suddenly disappeared in the close-knit jungle.
A few steps further the path opened at the junction
of a tributary river, and on the several banks was
disclosed a large pueblo, silent as the grave; but the
smoke yet curling from the ruins showed that it
had only recently been abandoned. In the nearest
suburb, which contained some two hundred houses,
they remained for nearly three weeks. Meanwhile
a bridge of three hundred paces was built across a
marsh, and expeditions were sent out in vain search
for reliable guides, and to explore the neighborhood.<a id='FA_XVIII-15' href='#FN_XVIII-15' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-15]</a>
</p>

<p>
The next objective point was Chilapan, capital of
a province bearing the same name; this they also
found burned and deserted, but well provided with
food. The crossing of the river here, which detained
the army for over a week, was effected on rafts, but
despite the care taken the rushing torrent played
havoc with the baggage. Beyond this lay a marshy
tract only six leagues in extent, but so troublesome
as to detain them two days. The horses suffered
severely, sinking many times up to the ears, as
Cortés expresses it, and endangering the safety of
the men in their struggles, so much so that three
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_543' href='#Page_543'>543</a></span>
Spaniards were lost, beside a number of Indians.<a id='FA_XVIII-16' href='#FN_XVIII-16' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-16]</a>
After a week's rest at the ruined yet well-stocked
Tamacaztepec, they made another marshy journey
of three days before reaching Iztapan, a fine large
pueblo on the banks of the Usumacinta, burned and
deserted like the preceding. The Cihuatlatecs had,
it seems, in their wild scamper spread the most
blood-curdling stories of the fierceness and cruelty
of the Spaniards. The timidity of the natives was
proving inconvenient, and guides were sent out to
assure the inhabitants of the peaceful intent of the
invaders. The caciques were encouraged to tender
submission in person, and were rewarded with presents,
accompanied by a grandiloquent discourse about
"the greatest prince on earth," and the mission he
had given Cortés to remedy evils, bestow benefits,
and point the way to salvation.<a id='FA_XVIII-17' href='#FN_XVIII-17' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-17]</a>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">CONQUERING AND TO CONQUER.</div>

<p>
A week's rest was taken, during which half a dozen
Spaniards were sent up the river in canoes to receive
the submission of chiefs, not to mention the accompanying
presents that were to indicate the wealth of
the district. Three soldiers were also sent down the
stream, to Tabasco, with orders for the fleet to sail
to Ascension Bay,<a id='FA_XVIII-18' href='#FN_XVIII-18' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-18]</a> after sending boats with provisions
and stores to Acalan. It was to follow the shore
so as to be near the army, if possible, for "it is believed,"
writes Cortés, "though not for certain, that
the natives pass through the Bay of Términos to the
other sea, leaving Yucatan an island." One of the
three soldiers bearing the instructions was Francisco
de Medina, an ill-tempered, violent, but able man,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_544' href='#Page_544'>544</a></span>
with some knowledge of the country and the language,
who had managed to ingratiate himself with
his chief so far as to be commissioned to share the
command of the fleet with the actual captain, Simon
de Cuenca, one of Cortés' mayordomos. On reaching
the vessels at Xicalanco he assumed an overbearing
manner, and quarrelled with Cuenca about the command
till it came to blows. Perceiving the state
of affairs the natives watched their opportunity,
attacked and killed the crew, pillaged the vessels,
and burned them to remove the evidence. The news
spread until it reached the capital, although in a distorted
form, which gave the impression that Cortés
and all his force had perished. The anxiety became
so great that Ordaz, one of the favorite officers of
Cortés, set out among others to ascertain the truth
of the report. Following the coast by water, he
reached the scene of the slaughter, and received
such evidence as to lead him to declare that the
great leader must indeed be dead. Obsequies in his
honor were accordingly held at Mexico, after which
but a trusting few entertained hopes of ever seeing
him again.<a id='FA_XVIII-19' href='#FN_XVIII-19' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-19]</a>
</p>

<p class="p2">
Proceeding to Tatahuitlapan Cortés found the place
partly burned, and deserted by all save a score of
native priests, who inspired by duty had resolved to
stay and die with the idols as ordained by the oracle.
To show their impotence the images were destroyed,
while the keepers were exhorted to devote themselves
to the veneration of the cross, to whose merciful inspiration
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_545' href='#Page_545'>545</a></span>
they owed their safety. It was a sacred duty
with Cortés to erect the Christian emblem in all
pueblos and camping-places, and where ceiba-trees
grew they were fashioned into crosses which, blooming
anew, stood as living symbols of the saving faith. On
the crosses were fastened notices of the expedition.
In this region exists to-day a village called Las Tres
Cruces, from three crosses said to have been left by
Cortés. The place is barely thirty miles from the
famous ruins of Palenque, yet no allusion is made
by the conquerors to the stupendous structures, the
matchless palaces, and the curious sculptures there
existing. Once the object of admiration and worship
to countless pilgrims from far-off districts, the city
now lay wrapped within the secure folds of dense
forests, and only tradition spoke of her past glories.
Perhaps it was well for the fortune-hunters, at least,
that vegetation had obliterated the highways which
in times past must have led to the shrine of the
'tree of life' from the malarious lowlands of the
Usumacinta region, for a sight of such grandeur
might have awakened hopes never to be realized, and
prompted expeditions ending only in disaster.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">DARK FORESTS AND MORASSES.</div>

<p>
They now struck across to Huetecpan,<a id='FA_XVIII-20' href='#FN_XVIII-20' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-20]</a> higher up
the river, and, after wading through a slough, plunged
into a forest whose close growth shut out the very
light of heaven.<a id='FA_XVIII-21' href='#FN_XVIII-21' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-21]</a> Here they groped for two days
along the sappers' path, till they found themselves
back on the route already traversed. Pressed by the
troubled leaders the guides cried out that they were
lost. This admission was not without danger, for the
provisions were exhausted, and the men filled with
gloomy forebodings, which found vent with many in
curses on their leader for having brought them to
such a pass. They demanded that the swine be
slaughtered, but the mayordomo, who had prudently
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_546' href='#Page_546'>546</a></span>
let the drove fall behind, intimated that the alligators
had eaten them. They must be content with the
scanty sustenance of roots and berries. Meanwhile
Cortés had recourse to his maps and compass, and
determined on a north-east course as the most likely
to lead to his destination. This calculation proved
correct, and although the place was in ruins, there
was enough of food to bury gloom in feasting. Soldiers
being sent in search of guides, found a little
beyond the river a lake where the inhabitants had
taken refuge in canoes and on islands. Finding
themselves discovered the natives came fearlessly
forth, stating that the Spanish boat expedition from
Iztapan had reassured them, so much so that a
brother of the cacique had joined the party with
four armed canoes for convoy. The boats being
recalled, brought evidence of the submission tendered
by four or five pueblos in a cargo of honey and other
delicacies, with a little gold. Similar contributions
flowed from different pueblos whose inhabitants came
to gaze at the bearded men.<a id='FA_XVIII-22' href='#FN_XVIII-22' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-22]</a>
</p>

<p>
Explorers were sent forward as on previous occasions,
to report on the road, but finding it comparatively
easy for some distance they neglected to
examine the remainder,<a id='FA_XVIII-23' href='#FN_XVIII-23' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-23]</a> and misled the army as to
the nature of the route. Beyond lay a large province
bounded by the Laguna de Términos, the
broad Usumacinta, and the ranges of Vera Paz, a
low-lying country abounding in morasses, miasmatic
inlets, and winding rivers tributary to the Términos.
The fertility of this naturally irrigated tract, not
inaptly known as Acalan, 'land of boats,' was evident
in the rank growth of the vegetation, and the
great variety of products. No roads existed, but
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_547' href='#Page_547'>547</a></span>
the numerous streams provided a series of highways
which the enterprising natives had not failed to
utilize in carrying their surplus products to arid and
less rich provinces, especially to the north-east and
south, and in bringing back slaves and compact
treasures. It was quite natural for a people engaged
in traffic to choose as ruler the richest trader, and
such a one was the present, Apochpalon<a id='FA_XVIII-24' href='#FN_XVIII-24' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-24]</a> by name.
To him were sent a number of Spaniards and Indians<a id='FA_XVIII-25' href='#FN_XVIII-25' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-25]</a>
with a reassuring message and an invitation
to meet Cortés.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">BRIDGE-BUILDING.</div>

<p>
After a three days' march over a rough mountain
track, the army suddenly found the path obstructed
by a deep channel five hundred paces wide, with
slimy borders. The passage was shown to be practicable
only by means of a bridge which required
patient labor, since the depth of water and mud proved
to be fully six fathoms. Great was the dismay, for
there were hardly any provisions left, and to recross
the mountain was a formidable task under the circumstances.
The murmurs of the worn-out soldiers
were loud enough at the first sight of the obstruction,
and when Cortés with his usual audacity gave
orders to build a bridge, they rose almost into
mutiny. The leader had been in worse troubles
however. He knew every trait of a Spanish soldier's
character, and he was versed in blandishments.
He showed the futility of retreat, since apart from
the mountain road, so long and severe, freshets must
by this time have washed away the means of recrossing
rivers, and no provisions were left in the deserted
pueblos. Before them, on the other hand, lay a land
of plenty, seamed with gold. He would guarantee
the completion of the bridge within five days, or, this
failing, he would follow their wishes. Wily Cortés!
Could he induce them to begin the work, he would
trust his wits to secure its completion. But the men
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_548' href='#Page_548'>548</a></span>
remained sullen. They would die of hunger before
the bridge was finished. Hibueras would never be
reached. "Very well," said Cortés, "be spectators, I
will build the bridge with the aid of Indians alone."
Brief persuasion was needed with the latter, for the
chiefs were in the tyrant's hands, and their word was
law to their followers. Timber was felled, and with
the aid of rafts the piling began. Shamed by this
measure the Spaniards joined in the work, and to
cheer them the solitary musician who had not fainted
beneath the hardships of the march was ordered to
play some cheering airs. But the men cried, "Peace!
we want bread, not music." The gnawings of hunger
could not be appeased with empty sound.
</p>

<p>
While some thus worked diligently on the bridge,
others went in search of roots and berries, but with
poor success. Overcome by famine and fatigue numbers
lay down to die, while, to add to the catalogue
of horrors, several of the Indian guides were seized
by native auxiliaries and cooked. Among the victims
to the adventure thus far, says Torquemada, was
Fray Juan de Tecto, who, exhausted by hunger, leaned
his head against a tree and surrendered his spirit.<a id='FA_XVIII-26' href='#FN_XVIII-26' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-26]</a>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">MORE AND DEEPER SLOUGHS.</div>

<p>
Before the expiration of a week the bridge was
completed, a painful work indeed for fainting men, ill-furnished
with the means, to perform within so short
a time. It was composed, says Cortés, of a thousand
trees, nine to ten fathoms long, the smallest almost as
thick as a man, besides a quantity of small timber,
secured with wooden pegs and withes. For years
this and several other 'bridges of Malinche' remained
a source of utility and wonder to the natives, who
declared that nothing was impossible to the white
man.<a id='FA_XVIII-27' href='#FN_XVIII-27' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-27]</a> Hunger and toil were for the moment forgotten
in congratulations over the completion of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_549' href='#Page_549'>549</a></span>
the structure, but their joy was of short duration.
Hardly had the rear of the army crossed the bridge
when the van came to a slough which surpassed in
difficulties any yet encountered. The horses sank
almost out of sight, and it was only by the united
efforts of the army that the beasts, on which their
success so greatly depended, were finally extricated.
This trouble over they were cheered by the arrival
of Bernal Diaz, who had been absent foraging. It
was not always that he returned so well laden, for
now he had one hundred and thirty loads of maize
and a quantity of fowl and other provisions. Sometimes
he could find nothing; sometimes what he
found he hid, lest with the starving army he himself
should starve. He was sure it would be snatched
from his hands the moment he entered camp; and so
it was on the present occasion; the soldiers pounced
upon and devoured it like famished wolves. During
the scramble were seized also the stores intended for
the officers, so that the general himself could not
obtain a crumb. Fortunately Bernal Diaz had with
his usual foresight placed in cache a portion of these
very provisions, and suspecting this Cortés so petted
and praised the old soldier<a id='FA_XVIII-28' href='#FN_XVIII-28' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-28]</a> that he had no longer
the heart to withhold the food.
</p>

<p>
With Bernal Diaz came also messengers from the
cacique bringing presents, including a little gold, and
offering the hospitality of his realm. The following
day Tizapetlan was reached, where food had been prepared.
There the expedition remained a week. The
attentive natives were awed no less by the number
of the invaders than by their strange appearance.
The horses were a perpetual source of wonder, and
offerings of roses were made to allay the anger displayed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_550' href='#Page_550'>550</a></span>
by their fierce pawing. The merchant-chief
had thought it prudent to be obsequious to men so
formidable; but, when he saw how food disappeared
before them, and how greedily every valuable was
appropriated, he trembled with apprehension. If
they were content to stay and feast for a week in one
of his miserable border towns, how long might they
not tarry in the central cities of the richer districts?
To rid the province of the cormorants, the cacique
pretended to have died, directing his son to lead
them quickly in upon the lands of a neighbor. After
the funeral rites and interchange of presents, the
young man addressed the Spaniards. "You would
reach the settlements of your countrymen in Honduras.
They are quite near; hardly eight days distant
is Nito, where are floating houses, and bearded men
on giant deer."
</p>

<p>
This he could affirm, for there was an Acalan
factory, and at its head Apochpalon's own brother,
who had told him of these things. This news was
more to the cacique's purpose than any artifice, and
eagerly the expedition hurried to Teotilac,<a id='FA_XVIII-29' href='#FN_XVIII-29' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-29]</a> five or
six leagues off, guided thither by the dutiful young
chief over a circuitous route.<a id='FA_XVIII-30' href='#FN_XVIII-30' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-30]</a>
</p>

<p>
The ruler of Teotilac was by no means pleased
to find thrown upon him this hungry host; and
he revealed to Cortés the trickery of Apochpalon.
Thereupon Cortés ordered the dead man immediately
to appear. Two days later, accordingly, the
sovereign-cacique arrived, looking most sheepish.
He proffered innumerable excuses, and tendered as
amends the hospitality of the capital. The offer was
too tempting not to procure his forgiveness.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_551' href='#Page_551'>551</a></span>
</p>

<p>
One of the two temples serving for army headquarters
at Teotilac was occupied by a goddess,
whose fierce passions could be appeased only with the
blood of beautiful virgins. To insure the genuineness
of the vestal offering, so that a mistake might
not render it fruitless, girls were selected in infancy
and brought up in strictest seclusion within the
temple walls, till came the time for yielding their fair
forms to the sacrifice. Cortés sought to impress on
the people the absurdity of so atrocious a superstition,
and destroyed the idol.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">CONSPIRACY OF THE CAPTIVE KINGS.</div>

<p class="p2">
This place is remarkable for one incident which
concerned the safety of the Spaniards, according to
their account, and left an indelible impression on the
natives of New Spain. Among those who followed
the expedition as hostages, as we have seen, were
three deposed kings, two of whom were now accused
of treachery, Quauhtemotzin, and Tetlepanquetzal.
These patriots were criminal in the eyes of the Spaniards;
they had dared to regard the invaders as the
enemies of their country, and bitterly to oppose them.
It seemed now convenient to Cortés that they should
die, and excuse was not wanting for killing them.
Suffering every hardship of the march, the royal
captives had found some consolation in observing
how heavily it bore on their keepers, toiling, starving,
discontented, blundering along an unknown and
dangerous route. But this was not their only feeling.
Quauhtemotzin, the sovereign, the general, the
tactician, could not fail to observe the disparity between
his followers and the hated white men. The
latter were reduced in strength by famine and hardships,
in the midst of a strange country, far from
relief, while the Mexicans, if also weakened, and
not so well armed, were tenfold more numerous, and
more at home in these wilds. Inspired by a deeply
rooted devotion to their traditions, to their princes,
to their country, the merest whisper of revenge, of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_552' href='#Page_552'>552</a></span>
freedom, could not fail to find response. Yes, sweet
was the thought of revenge; equally sweet the prospect
of a triumphal return to Mexico, there to be
greeted as a liberator ordained to restore the ancient
grandeur of Montezuma's court; finally, perhaps, to
be exalted by a grateful people to the pantheon of
the gods, a dream so worthy the soldier and patriot,
how oft may it not have smiled upon his fancy!
What more natural, what more commendable indeed,
than projects for the liberation not alone of the
auxiliary host, but of their country and kindred?
Treachery had been used to reduce them, and treachery
must be met with treachery. This was justifiable,
although the Indians probably weighed not the
moral aspect of the question. As for the risk, one
blow, one death, was preferable to the daily death
which they were suffering on this journey. Yes,
they must take advantage of the opportunity presented,
and while the Spaniards were engrossed by
the difficulties of some mountain pass, or engulfed in
some morass, fall upon them, especially upon the
feared Cortés, and then, with the prestige of victors,
return to Mexico, where their compatriots would
meanwhile, under advice, have risen simultaneously
against the now disorganized and squabbling colonists,
reduced as they were in numbers.<a id='FA_XVIII-31' href='#FN_XVIII-31' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-31]</a>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE KILLING OF THE KINGS.</div>

<p>
How long the plot had been brewing is not stated,
but during the stay at Teotilac Cortés was startled
by a revelation from a prominent Mexican,<a id='FA_XVIII-32' href='#FN_XVIII-32' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-32]</a> who gave
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_553' href='#Page_553'>553</a></span>
him a paper with the names of the conspirators in
hieroglyphics. Several were seized, and under separate
examination confessed to the existence of the
plot, although disclaiming for themselves of course
any actual participation.<a id='FA_XVIII-33' href='#FN_XVIII-33' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-33]</a> Quauhtemotzin was also
questioned, and admitted, says Bernal Diaz, that the
hardships and dangers had aroused rebellious sentiments
among the Indians, but claimed that he was not
the author, and judging from his own feelings he regarded
the whole thing as mere talk. A quick secret
trial was held, and the sentence of death by hanging
pronounced against Quauhtemotzin and Tetlepanquetzal,<a id='FA_XVIII-34' href='#FN_XVIII-34' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-34]</a>
who were dragged forth during the stillness
of the night to a ceiba-tree, where they met their
fate. Cortés was present at the execution, and to
him Quauhtemotzin addressed himself, writes Bernal
Diaz. "Malinche, many a day have I suspected the
falsity of thy words, and that thou hadst destined
this end to my life. Why dost thou kill me without
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_554' href='#Page_554'>554</a></span>
justice? God will demand of thee thy answer!"
Tetlepanquetzal calmly expressed himself content to
die with his royal companion, and together they
listened to the exhortations of the friars, dying like
true Christians.<a id='FA_XVIII-35' href='#FN_XVIII-35' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-35]</a> The execution took place during
the carnival days preceding shrove-tide, and appears
to have created no excitement either among Indians
or Spaniards.<a id='FA_XVIII-36' href='#FN_XVIII-36' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-36]</a>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">EXCUSES FOR THE ATROCITY.</div>

<p>
Most Spanish authorities are of course inclined to
uphold the act as a necessary punishment for a proven
crime. Yet certain men, like Torquemada, a champion
of the natives, and modern Mexican writers, side
with the Indians in stamping it as a foul murder, carried
out merely to be rid of the kings whose presence
was becoming a burden to the conquerors. Others,
like Bernal Diaz, soften the deed into a mistake,
based on insufficient evidence, and prompted by a desire
to smother a conspiracy which some imaginary
spirits had conjured.<a id='FA_XVIII-37' href='#FN_XVIII-37' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-37]</a> But Cortés would hardly have
removed so valuable a hostage without good reason.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_555' href='#Page_555'>555</a></span>
The reason being admitted, and this to some extent
even by native records, the precarious situation of the
Spaniards demanded that Cortés should take measures
commensurate with the apparent danger.<a id='FA_XVIII-38' href='#FN_XVIII-38' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-38]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_556' href='#Page_556'>556</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Many of the natives, particularly those now encountering
the Spaniards for the first time, regarded
the discovery of the conspiracy with superstitious
awe. The idea of treachery by an accomplice did
not seem to so occur to them, but with mysterious
shaking of the head they pointed to the compass and
chart. Instruments which had so unaccountably, and
better than any guide, pointed out the road and saved
the army from destruction, could of course reveal a
simple conspiracy. Nothing could be hidden from the
owner of that needle. Conscious, perhaps, of some
stray unfriendly thought, many hastened to Cortés to
protest their devotion. "Look into the mirror, and
you will find it so," they said, alluding to the compass,
yet quaking the while lest a suspicion should there
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_557' href='#Page_557'>557</a></span>
stand depicted. Apochpalon was so affected that he
hastened to tender allegiance and to burn idols. So
convenient a belief was not to be disturbed, and the
natives were allowed to nurse it.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ARMY AT IZANCANAC.</div>

<p class="p2">
The army now proceeded to Izancanac,<a id='FA_XVIII-39' href='#FN_XVIII-39' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-39]</a> the populous
capital of Acalan, conducted by Apochpalon in
person. He was mounted on a horse, and the first
apprehensions over, he strode his steed with childish
delight. The soldiers were treated with sumptuous
hospitality, and Cortés was gratified with presents of
gold and women. Meanwhile, to facilitate the further
march, the road was improved, a bridge built, and
guides were provided, besides an advance corps laden
with provisions. In return for all this Apochpalon
asked merely for a letter to prove to other white
comers that he had been faithful.
</p>

<p>
There was every inducement to prolong the stay
at Izancanac, served and feasted as they were, but
the nearness of the Spanish settlements, as alluringly
depicted by the calculating Apochpalon, was
an incentive for all to proceed. Laden with rations
for a week, they departed on the first Sunday in Lent
from the fair province of Acalan, over which, the
protective letter notwithstanding, the withering influence
of Spaniards was soon to fall. On the third
day they entered the prairie-studded province of
the Mazatecs,<a id='FA_XVIII-40' href='#FN_XVIII-40' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-40]</a> so called from the abundance of deer.
These animals were here regarded with veneration,
and the consequent immunity from pursuit had made
them not only numerous, but tame. The soldiers,
being restrained by no scruples of native superstition,
could not resist the temptation of a chase over the
verdure-clad fields, and soon a score of deer were
added to the larder. The following day they came to
a frontier fortress, built on a rock, and bounded on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_558' href='#Page_558'>558</a></span>
one side by a lake, on the other by a river, and with
only one means of access. Besides this natural
strength it was protected by a double stockade with
moats, surmounted by towers, and the houses were
also provided with shot-holes. The place was in fact
impregnable, and every precaution was taken to meet
the resistance for which the attack of some lately
captured scouts had prepared them. Cautiously they
advanced toward the entrance. Not a sound, not a
movement. An ambuscade must have been formed,
since no gate barred the entry. But within reigned
silence, and it was only on reaching the plaza that
some chiefs appeared with humble obeisance. This
was one of the asylums erected by the Mazatecs for
refuge against the wild Lacandones. But what availed
walls and arms against the irresistible bearded men
who controlled the lightning. Them the inhabitants
dared not resist. They had fled to mountain fastnesses,
leaving their wealth of provisions and arms at
the disposal of the invaders, with the sole request
that the place be not destroyed. The chiefs were reassured,
and after replenishing their stores the Spaniards
proceeded for seven leagues to a larger and similar
pueblo called Tiac, situated on a plain, within a stockade,
each of its three wards being provided with
separate palisades. The caciques of this and several
other pueblos of the province, each independent and
quarrelsome, sent messengers with presents and offers
of allegiance, but could not be prevailed upon to come
in person with their people. The guides here obtained
gave the cheering information that the white
men were not far off, and conducted them to Ahuncahuitl,
the last pueblo of this province, also fortified,
and amply provisioned, so much so that rations were
taken for the five days' march which intervened before
reaching the province of the Itzas.<a id='FA_XVIII-41' href='#FN_XVIII-41' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-41]</a>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">ARRIVAL AT THE ITZA CAPITAL.</div>

<p>
Four nights were spent in the mountains, in which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_559' href='#Page_559'>559</a></span>
was a bad pass, called Alabastro from the appearance
of the rock. They now came to a small lake with an
island pueblo, from which the inhabitants fled as the
soldiers waded over.<a id='FA_XVIII-42' href='#FN_XVIII-42' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-42]</a> The following day they were
surprised to behold the gleaming walls and lofty temples
of a large pueblo, situated on an isle several miles
from shore, in a large sheet of water, which Cortés
assumed to be an arm of the sea.<a id='FA_XVIII-43' href='#FN_XVIII-43' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-43]</a> But his ordeal
was not yet over. It was the lake now known as
Peten, and the pueblo was Tayasal,<a id='FA_XVIII-44' href='#FN_XVIII-44' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-44]</a> the capital of
the Itzas, which recalled in a measure to the old conquerors
the first and never to be forgotten view of the
famous queen city enthroned in the lake of Mexico.
</p>

<p>
The natives had taken to their canoes on the
approach of the Spaniards, and heeded no signs or
appeals, but with the aid of a dog a solitary boatman
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_560' href='#Page_560'>560</a></span>
was captured. A friendly message was now
despatched to the canek inviting him to a conference,
and offering hostages. It was not long ere six large
canoes approached the shore, and some thirty persons
stepped fearlessly forth. At their head came one
whose commanding figure and quiet dignity announced
the ruler. A flowing white robe disclosed
an elaborately tattooed skin, relieved by an embroidered
maxtli. The braided hair was surmounted by
a head-dress of feathers, and the face, also tattooed
with black lines, was further ornamented with gold
pendants in nose and ears. He bade Cortés welcome,
and expressed himself secure in his company
without the proffered hostage.
</p>

<p>
It was the hour for mass, and with a view both to
please him and to teach a pious lesson, the ceremony
was held with chant and instrumental accompaniment.
The faith was thereupon explained by a friar,
with so good an effect that the chief promised to
destroy his idols and venerate the cross till teachers
should arrive to give him full instruction. As an
earnest of his intention presents were produced, consisting
chiefly of provisions, with a few strings of
red shells highly valued by the natives, and other
trinkets; and though the gold was small in quantity,
yet it encouraged Cortés to give in return a shirt, a
velvet cap, and some cutlery. News had reached
the island city of the doings of the Europeans, not
only at Naco and Nito, but in Tabasco, where the
natives some years before had been conquered in
three battles. Cortés hastened to assure the canek
that he saw before him the hero of those famed
encounters, and finding that an impression had been
produced, he warmed with a description of the power
and grandeur of the greatest prince on earth. The
canek was not merely impressed but awed, so much
so that he at once tendered allegiance.
</p>

<p>
With new guides the main body proceeded round
the lake southward, while Cortés entered the canoes
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_561' href='#Page_561'>561</a></span>
with a score of archers to visit the island city. The
officers sought to dissuade him from risking his person
in the hands of a perhaps treacherous enemy, but
the general did not wish to be surpassed in fearlessness
and confidence.<a id='FA_XVIII-45' href='#FN_XVIII-45' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-45]</a> He was greatly admired by
the islanders who thronged round his mailed followers
with mingled curiosity and awe. On leaving he commended
to their care a black horse which had been
disabled by a wound in the leg. Ignorant of the
treatment required by the animal, and eager to do
reverence to the strange charge, they are said to have
offered it flowers and fowl, on which diet it died. The
grief of the Itzas was equalled only by their fear.
What would the white chief say when he returned?
Nothing now remained but to do homage to the carcass.
They had seen the flash of the fire-arm as the
mounted hunter chased the deer on the prairie, and
fancied that this as well as the report issued from
the horse. What more appropriate apotheosis of a
charger than into a god of thunder? As Tziminchac
it was accordingly adored. The bones were kept as
sacred relics while an effigy sejant of the animal,
formed of masonry, attracted direct worship.<a id='FA_XVIII-46' href='#FN_XVIII-46' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-46]</a>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">TOILSOME ADVANCE.</div>

<p>
The next resting-place of the army was at Tlecan,
a deserted pueblo some seven leagues from Tayasal,
where the Spaniards stayed for four days and provided
themselves with a week's rations. Six leagues
further a halt was made at a hamlet, in honor of the
virgin's festival.<a id='FA_XVIII-47' href='#FN_XVIII-47' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-47]</a> Nine leagues beyond, a rugged
pass was entered in which the rough sharp stones
tore from the horses feet their very shoes. The next
station bore the name Ahuncapun where a two days'
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_562' href='#Page_562'>562</a></span>
halt was made. Five leagues beyond lay Tachuytel,
after which began an eight league ascent of the
roughest mountains yet encountered, called de Pedernales,
Mountain of Flints. The horses could hardly
move a step without slipping, and cutting their legs
and bodies most dangerously. On any other occasion
the sight of suffering among the prized animals, the
chief reliance of the army, would have touched the
men deeply, but now they were too much absorbed
by their own sufferings to think of them. Many of
the soldiers were also becoming disabled, and the provisions
were giving out in the midst of the mountains,
which in many places offered not even a root. Days
passed by in slow and toilsome advance; none could
tell how much longer this long journey would last. A
heavy rain added to their torment, and past sufferings
were forgotten in the present. Many fell from exhaustion
and hunger, or slipped from the rocks into
the abyss; and so extreme was the need, says Herrera,
that one confessed to having eaten of the brains and
entrails of three men who had died of hunger.<a id='FA_XVIII-48' href='#FN_XVIII-48' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-48]</a>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">A FORMIDABLE FORD.</div>

<p>
Cortés did his utmost to encourage the men.
With pike in hand he would lead the march over the
difficult parts of the road; he cheered and consoled
them, and divided what he had with the sick and
famished. This energy, this sympathy and generosity
did wonders and animated the men to repress
their murmurs. Finally, after twelve days of toil,
says Cortés, the terrible flint road ended; but it had
cost the lives of several men, and sixty-eight horses
had fallen over the cliffs, or had been fatally disabled,
while the rest did not recover from the strains and
bruises for three months.<a id='FA_XVIII-49' href='#FN_XVIII-49' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-49]</a> Now the men began to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_563' href='#Page_563'>563</a></span>
breathe easier, but, as once before, the dawning
joy was abruptly checked by a formidable obstacle.
They found themselves on the banks of a wide river
whose waters tore by with a rapidity that made even
rafting impracticable. While the soldiers stood gazing
in mute despair at the barriers behind and in
front, praying for deliverance, Cortés sent out parties
to search for an outlet, and soon reports were brought
of a ford. It was as a reprieve from death. Te
Deum was solemnly chanted, and tough old soldiers
shed tears of joy. When the nature of the passage
was observed, it seemed indeed as if heaven had
decreed a miracle in their behalf. The ford, two
thirds of a league wide, consisted of a smooth ledge
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_564' href='#Page_564'>564</a></span>
stretching across the whole river, and intersected
by over twenty channels, through which the water
rushed with deafening roar. But even the channels
could not be crossed without bridges, and fully two
days were spent in felling timber for the twenty
passages.<a id='FA_XVIII-50' href='#FN_XVIII-50' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-50]</a>
</p>

<p>
It was Easter eve<a id='FA_XVIII-51' href='#FN_XVIII-51' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-51]</a> when the ford was crossed by
the infantry, followed by the disabled horses. Again
came a check to their joy. Tenciz, the pueblo at which
they now arrived, a league beyond the ford, had been
evacuated, and nearly all the supplies carried off.
For over ten days the men had eaten hardly anything
but palm-cabbage, and very little of that,
owing to the trouble in obtaining it.<a id='FA_XVIII-52' href='#FN_XVIII-52' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-52]</a> Fortunately,
some natives were found who guided a foraging party
back across the river a day's journey into the Tahuytal
province, where an abundance of provisions was
obtained, and which furnished the army with good
cheer during the five days' stay at Tenciz, and with
some rations for the journey into Acuculin province.
</p>

<p>
The guides here obtained ran away, and the Spaniards
had to advance with the aid of native maps alone.
The route was level, and eleven leagues were easily
covered in two days by crossing two rivers. This
brought them to a small settlement of Acalan traders,
who had been driven from Nito by the Spanish
excesses, and found refuge here. Soon after the capital
of the province was reached, but it was deserted
and almost devoid of provisions. This was most
discouraging, and to advance without guides appeared
dangerous. Notwithstanding the scanty sustenance
obtained from palm-cabbage, cooked with pork, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_565' href='#Page_565'>565</a></span>
unsalted, a week was spent in searching for guides.
Finally a boy was found who led them a day's journey
to a river in Taniha province, evidently Rio Sarstoon.
Following the stream downward for a couple of days
they came to Otulizti pueblo, where the natives reported
that Nito lay only two suns away. In proof
of this assertion two women were brought who had
served the Spaniards there. Hunger and fatigue
were forgotten in the rejoicing over this news, and
the men impatiently begged to be led onward.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">APPROACH TO NITO.</div>

<p>
But there was need for prudence, since nothing
was known about the condition of affairs in Honduras,
and the troops were not at present in a position
to meet a well-equipped foe, particularly if led by the
redoubtable Olid. Sandoval was accordingly sent forward
with a few chosen men to reconnoitre. It was not
far to the shore of the Amatique Bay, beyond which
lay the object of their journey. The bay was skirted
till they reached the wide stream which forms the
outlet of Golfo Dulce. Here they captured a trader's
canoe, and then hid themselves to see what next
should happen. It was not long before a canoe approached
with four white men, who were outflanked
and secured. They proved to be soldiers of Gil Gonzalez
stationed at Nito, to which site the old settlement
at San Gil de Buenavista had been transferred.<a id='FA_XVIII-53' href='#FN_XVIII-53' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-53]</a>
On the whole the account of affairs was cheering to
Sandoval, the main point being that the province was
quiet, and thoroughly devoted to Cortés, although
without a regular governor since the departure of
Casas. A messenger was at once despatched to relieve
the anxiety of the general, and the soldier to
whom the commission was intrusted reaped a rich
harvest from his overjoyed chief and comrades.

<p>
Cicero says that a man's best adviser is himself. A
wise man can find no better counsellor than his own
cool, impartial judgment. Cortés was a wise man,
and he could calmly judge. Had he counselled with
himself before setting out on this adventure? He
had led into Honduras, amidst great sufferings, an
army. The end of his perilous march brought to
him no great achievement, no great reward. There
was no Olid to punish; Casas was not a traitor.
Might not the proud conqueror with more advantage
have remained at home? The assurance of a ready
welcome, instead of a campaign against a formidable
rebel, was a relief to the way-worn soldiers; but
what thought the commander of it? It is not satisfying
to a sane man's pride to beat the air, or charge
on a windmill. A traitor to crush, or a fair city
to conquer, would have been refreshing pastime to
Cortés at this juncture.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">DESPERATE SITUATION OF THE COLONISTS.</div>

<p>
In advance of the army, and almost alone, he set
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_567' href='#Page_567'>567</a></span>
out for Nito. If he entered not as a conqueror with
sword in hand, he had at least the satisfaction of
being welcomed as a savior. Malaria was there, and
had so reduced the settlement that the frown of the
natives loomed over it like Erinnyan phantoms. There
were but three score Spaniards with a few women,<a id='FA_XIX-1' href='#FN_XIX-1' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-1]</a>
the greater number so reduced by fever and other
ailments as hardly to be able to move, and all suffering
from poor and insufficient food—zapotes, vegetables,
and fish. Without sufficient arms and without
horses, they did not venture abroad to forage, and
seeing that death would surely overtake all if they
remained, the able-bodied men under the leadership
of Diego Nieto were repairing a vessel in which to
depart.<a id='FA_XIX-2' href='#FN_XIX-2' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-2]</a> The disappearance of the four men captured
by Sandoval created no small alarm. Were they after
all to be overwhelmed by avenging natives? Amidst
such troubles no wonder that the appearance of Cortés
was greeted as a descent from heaven, and that even
men wept as they thronged round to kiss his hand.
</p>

<p>
The army was not a little surprised at the destitution
of the famed Honduras. While ministering
consolation, Cortés sent out bands of foragers. One
of the parties ascended the Rio Yasa,<a id='FA_XIX-3' href='#FN_XIX-3' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-3]</a> and coming to
a deserted hamlet, six leagues from the mouth, took
refuge from the rain. But it was not long before a
band of Indians set upon them, and badly wounded
they were driven to the boats, glad to escape with
life. Another party found a path leading to a well-provided
pueblo called Lequela, but it was eighteen
leagues away, and too far for carriers. A third division
met with better success.<a id='FA_XIX-4' href='#FN_XIX-4' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-4]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_568' href='#Page_568'>568</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile a vessel appeared in the harbor, having
on board thirty Spaniards, beside the crew, and
laden with a dozen horses, over seventy hogs, and
provisions. It seemed a miracle. And the whole
equipment Cortés bought for four thousand pesos.<a id='FA_XIX-5' href='#FN_XIX-5' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-5]</a>
Welcome as this was to the starving settlement, the
sudden change in diet cost the lives of several persons.
The site of Nito being so unhealthy and ill-provided,
it was resolved to abandon the place, and
Sandoval was sent with the greater number of soldiers,
settlers, and Indians, to the fertile valley of
Naco, Olid's abandoned headquarters, twenty leagues
off, on the road to which several well-supplied pueblos
offered good halting-places.
</p>

<p>
With the newly arrived vessel, a repaired caravel
and a brigantine, built from some wrecks, Cortés prepared
to take the remainder of the party by sea to a
better locality. But first he would ascend the wide
outlet lately crossed for food, for in this direction
some captives assured him he would find rich settlements.<a id='FA_XIX-6' href='#FN_XIX-6' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-6]</a>
Exploration also impelled him to this quarter,
for it was reported that when Gil Gonzalez first
arrived here he had detached a vessel for the examination
of this entrance; which had traversed two
fresh-water gulfs; but the ascent of a tributary
beyond had been prevented by strong currents and
warlike natives.<a id='FA_XIX-7' href='#FN_XIX-7' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-7]</a>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">CAPTURE OF PUEBLOS.</div>

<p>
Manning the new brigantine with forty chosen Spaniards
and a number of Indians, and attended by boats,
Cortés ascended the Rio Dulce, and speedily entered
a sheet of water some twelve leagues in circumference,
without settlements. Continuing south-west, he went
through a long passage into another larger sheet of
water lying amidst lofty ranges and most bewitching
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_569' href='#Page_569'>569</a></span>
scenery. Inspired by the wild grandeur around him,
he already fancied himself the laurel-crowned discoverer
of the long-sought strait. But the dream was
brief, for the water proved to be a gulf, some thirty
leagues in circumference, and called Apolochic in the
vernacular. Leaving the vessel at its western end,
near the mouth of a stream, he proceeded with most
of the men, under a local guide, over a rough route
intersected by innumerable creeks. After a march of
twelve leagues, during which only one village of any
importance was seen, he came to a pueblo in which
loud singing with instrumental accompaniment indicated
a festival. Waiting till a late hour, when all
was quiet, he fell upon the sleeping natives, and but
for the excited exclamation of a soldier the place
would have been taken without a blow. As it
was, the cacique had time to rally, and in the melée
which followed he with several others lost his life.
Forty captives were here secured. Cortés was now
guided to a larger pueblo, called Chacujal, eight
leagues further, and again resorted to a night attack,
but did not gain the place without considerable
resistance. By morning the Indians had fled. The
buildings, particularly the temples, resembled very
much those of Mexico, but the language differed as
well from the Mexican as from that of the pueblos
hitherto met with. Among the captives was an Indian
from the Pacific slope, who reported that only three-score
leagues intervened between Nito and his country,
where Alvarado was conquering.
</p>

<p>
The place was abundantly provided with cotton
goods, maize, the much-needed salt, and other articles,
and since it lay near the Polochic River, which entered
the gulf twenty leagues from where the vessel
lay, messengers were sent to bring it as far up the
stream as possible to receive supplies. Meanwhile four
rafts were made, and loaded each with forty fanegas
of maize, besides beans, cocoa, and other provisions.
These operations occupied nearly three weeks, during
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_570' href='#Page_570'>570</a></span>
which time none of the natives could be induced to
return and aid in the work.<a id='FA_XIX-8' href='#FN_XIX-8' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-8]</a> Cortés now embarked
with ten men on the rafts, sending the rest down
by land. The current carried them rapidly past the
winding banks, with their alternate forest and prairie
land, relieved here and there by hamlets and plantations,
half hidden amidst cocoa groves and fruit-trees.
Nothing unusual occurred till night, when Cortés, who
occupied the last raft, was startled by cries of alarm
from the one before him, followed by Indian yells.
It was too dark to distinguish anything, but the men
prepared for what might come. The next moment
the raft struck violently against a projecting rock,
and a shower of arrows fell. Several warriors now
attempted to board, but they either miscalculated the
distance, or were pushed overboard by the crew.
The Indians had foreseen the opportunity which
the rock would afford for an attack, but the rafts
escaped them, although most of the Spaniards were
wounded, including the general, and half a cargo
was damaged. So rapid was the current that the
twenty leagues were made by morning. More supplies
were obtained from other settlements, and on returning
to Nito after an absence of five weeks, sufficient
food was brought to fairly supply the fleet.
</p>

<p>
The whole colony, including Gonzalez' men, now
embarked in the three vessels and proceeded to San
Andrés Bay, or Caballos, where a number of Sandoval's
soldiers had just arrived. The site seemed to
be all that could be desired, "with the best port on the
entire coast from the Pearl Islands to Florida," with
fine indications of gold in the tributary rivers, and with
a beautiful and well-settled neighborhood. A colony
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_571' href='#Page_571'>571</a></span>
was accordingly founded there under the name of Natividad
de Nuestra Señora, from the day of founding,
and fifty settlers were left, chiefly Gonzalez' men
and late arrivals from Spain, Diego de Godoy being
appointed commander, with the necessary officials.
A church was also built and placed in charge of a
clergyman. Soon, however, the unhealthiness of the
site became apparent, and half the settlers died.
The Indians grew insolent and refused supplies, and
threatened the destruction of the settlement. Cortés
thereupon permitted the colonists to join the prosperous
establishment at Naco. Here the Indians
had been gradually reassured and conciliated by Sandoval,
whose armed incursions had already reduced a
number of pueblos of considerable size and wealth.<a id='FA_XIX-9' href='#FN_XIX-9' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-9]</a>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">AT TRUJILLO.</div>

<p>
Cortés had meanwhile sailed to Trujillo, where the
delighted colonists rushed into the water to carry the
renowned chief ashore. His first and characteristic
act was to enter the church and give thanks for safe
arrival.<a id='FA_XIX-10' href='#FN_XIX-10' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-10]</a> Then came the exercise of clemency for
which he was humbly besought by the late adherents
of Olid. Matters had been going smoothly since
Ruano was exiled, and the general was too prudent to
stir up animosity. With some slight reconstruction,
therefore, the orders and arrangements of Casas were
confirmed. An impulse was given to the town, and
with the enforced aid of native laborers lots were
cleared and buildings erected.
</p>

<p>
The four vessels now in port were not allowed to
lie idle. One was despatched to Mexico with the
invalids, and with letters for the officials, wherein
Cortés commended their zeal for the government, and
promised soon to return. Juan de Ávalos, his cousin,
was placed in command, and ordered to pick up at
Cozumel Island the party of Spaniards left there
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_572' href='#Page_572'>572</a></span>
by Valenzuela. This was done, but on approaching
Cuba the vessel was wrecked at Cape San Antonio,
with the loss of the captain, two friars, and over
thirty others. Of the rest only fifteen survived to
reach Guaniguanico.<a id='FA_XIX-11' href='#FN_XIX-11' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-11]</a> Of the other vessels, the new
brigantine was sent to Española to report to the
oidores concerning the overland expedition and the
state of affairs in Honduras, and to represent that the
kidnapping raid by Moreno was creating trouble among
the natives. The authorities ordered the captives to
be returned.<a id='FA_XIX-12' href='#FN_XIX-12' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-12]</a> The two remaining vessels were despatched
to Cuba and Jamaica with the plate and
jewels of Cortés to purchase provisions, live stock,
and plants wherewith to improve the colony.
</p>

<p>
One of these ships, in touching at Cuba, found there
a vessel from Santo Domingo, destined by the oidores
for Mexico to gain positive information about the
rumored death of Cortés, and to report on measures
against the disorders that might follow. Learning
that the conqueror was alive and in Honduras, the
messenger of the oidores resolved at once to change
the route to Honduras, where his cargo of horses and
stores would also find a readier market.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">BAD NEWS FROM MEXICO.</div>

<p class="p2">
Licenciado Zuazo, the most honorable and trusted
of the administrators appointed by Cortés over Mexico,
had been arrested by his colleagues for opposing their
nefarious plans, and sent out of the way to Cuba.
These men had not only seized on the administrative
power for their own advancement, to the neglect of
public welfare, but, believing the mighty conqueror
and his companions in arms to be dead, they had laid
hands on their estates, and were persecuting their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_573' href='#Page_573'>573</a></span>
friends and whosoever ventured to protest. The
country was in a most critical condition. Anarchy
and spoliation were the order of the day. The colonists
were arrayed in opposition to each other, and
the Indians found every encouragement for rising
against their white oppressors and blotting them out
of existence.
</p>

<p>
All this was reported by Zuazo in a letter to
Cortés, with the most earnest pleading for his immediate
return, ere it was too late.<a id='FA_XIX-13' href='#FN_XIX-13' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-13]</a> Cortés was at first
furious; then he melted into tears at the thought of
the desolation wrought by his enemies and at the
inhuman persecution of his followers. "It serves me
right," he said, in a calmer moment, "to be thus
treated for placing trust in strangers and ignoring
tried comrades."<a id='FA_XIX-14' href='#FN_XIX-14' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-14]</a> The news reached him at an unfavorable
time. The iron will and nerve which had
carried the leader through the hardships of the march,
had begun to yield to the insidious influence of the
fever-infected bottom-lands of the Amatique Bay,
assisted perhaps by disappointment at finding the
first aspect of Honduras so far below his hopes. The
letter served to rouse his bodily as well as mental
energies, though not to that point of clear and prompt
determination which had hitherto characterized his
acts. He was irresolute. Honduras had been little
explored, and the indication of gold near Caballos,
though small, led him still to dwell on the stories
of richer districts to the south. He feared to abandon
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_574' href='#Page_574'>574</a></span>
a yet promising field, after the efforts lavished on
it, and in view of the eager advance of his southern
rival, him of Panamá.
</p>

<p>
The fortunate predictions of a soldier-astrologer in
Mexico would not have made him disinclined, in his
present frame of mind, to encourage similar counsellors;
but no Sabean was at hand to interpret the scintillating
oracles. The friars were directed to appeal
to the supreme throne, and for three days services
were held, with processions, and masses, and prayers
for divine direction. Already during the progress of
these appeals, Cortés felt a dawning inspiration in
a renewed courage to face the treacherous sea, and
stronger inclination to trust the development of the
province to another. He would return to Mexico.
Hernando Saavedra, his cousin, was appointed captain-general
of Honduras,<a id='FA_XIX-15' href='#FN_XIX-15' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-15]</a> and Sandoval was directed to
proceed with his company from Naco to Mexico,
by the Guatemala route already opened by Casas.
He himself embarked on the government vessel, but
at the moment of departure the wind failed, and hearing
of a tumult among the colonists he landed to
restore order. The unruly spirits appear to have been
disappointed office-seekers, to whom the obscurity of
official existence in a border province seemed a most
ungracious return for their long toil. The general
calmed the leading rioters by taking them on board
to receive their reward in Mexico. Two days later
he set sail, only to meet another check in the breakage
of the main lateen yard just outside the harbor.
After three days spent in repairs he again departed,
with a good wind, but this soon increased to a gale,
and fifty leagues from port the mast went overboard
and obliged him to return for a third time.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">TIRED OF THE SEA.</div>

<p>
Surely, this was a warning from providence not to
proceed. He must have misunderstood the inspiration,
and would seek more correct advice. Upon one
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_575' href='#Page_575'>575</a></span>
thing he was determined, not again to trust himself
to the billows. The last tossings had cured him
of nautical aspirations, and threatened indeed to cure
him of all others, for his already weakened body was
left in so racked a condition as to bring him near to
death. Bernal Diaz describes him as a mere shadow
of his former self, and states that a Franciscan robe
had been prepared to shroud his body, and by its saving
virtues to assist the soul through purgatory.<a id='FA_XIX-16' href='#FN_XIX-16' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-16]</a>
But, although the conqueror of Mexico had filled the
measure of his great achievements, the cup of honors
and of disappointments was not yet full. Masses had
again been said to sanctify as inspiration his changing
resolve. The vessel proceeded, however, bearing a
trusted servant<a id='FA_XIX-17' href='#FN_XIX-17' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-17]</a> with letters for a number of friends
in Mexico, and with orders revoking the power
granted to the usurping governors in favor of more
reliable men. A number of Mexican chiefs accompanied
the messenger to testify that Cortés still lived.
They were to proceed to Pánuco after landing the
servant in some obscure haven above Vera Cruz,
whence he was to proceed alone and in disguise to
Mexico, so as to elude any watching enemies. Sandoval
was recalled, greatly to the disappointment of
his party, who rose almost in open mutiny at being
kept away from their estates in Mexico, which were
by this time exposed to ruin in hands of strangers and
usurpers.<a id='FA_XIX-18' href='#FN_XIX-18' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-18]</a>
</p>

<p>
An additional excuse for the determination to
remain may have been found in the hostile attitude
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_576' href='#Page_576'>576</a></span>
of two provinces, Papayeca and Chapagua, some
seven leagues from Trujillo.<a id='FA_XIX-19' href='#FN_XIX-19' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-19]</a> Some time before this
Saavedra had been sent to explore the valley above,
and following it for some thirty leagues found a fertile
district with a series of flourishing pueblos. A
score of caciques appeared to offer their allegiance
to Cortés, and into Trujillo flowed provisions and
presents. The above-named provinces alone held
aloof, pleading not without reason former maltreatment
and the kidnapping of tribal members by Fiscal
Moreno. No excuses could, however, be regarded as
valid in refusing allegiance, and Saavedra marched
against them. The people retired to the hills; but
three of the Chapagua caciques being captured and
peremptorily given a fixed term in which to repeople
their towns, the submission of this province was
speedily effected. Papayeca was now entered, and
Pizacura, one of the two principal caciques, was captured.
He threw the blame of resistance on his
more powerful colleague, Mazatl, offering if released
to secure and hang him, and thus bring the people
over. Once free, the cacique cast the promise to the
winds as readily as any Spaniard. Mazatl was captured,
nevertheless, and given the alternative of repeopling
the towns or dying. The chief disdainfully
rejected an offer to purchase life with what he regarded
as the enslavement of his people, and calmly accepted
death.
</p>

<p>
This severity was thought to be prudent, and it
certainly had the effect of bringing the inhabitants
back to all the pueblos save the capital. Here Pizacura
held forth, supposing, no doubt, that since his
escapade no pardon was to be expected. He was soon
captured, however, together with over a hundred followers.
The latter were enslaved for their obstinacy,
while he, with two other caciques, and a youth who
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_577' href='#Page_577'>577</a></span>
appears to have been the true chief of the province,
were kept as prisoners.<a id='FA_XIX-20' href='#FN_XIX-20' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-20]</a>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">PACIFICATION OF THE COUNTRY.</div>

<p>
This success, as well as the comparatively kind
treatment of the natives, tended greatly to promote
the pacification of the country, and the name of Cortés
became feared and respected far and wide.<a id='FA_XIX-21' href='#FN_XIX-21' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-21]</a> One
instance of this was the arrival of a deputation from
the Gulf Islands, appealing to his power and clemency
for protection against a slaving party which was
raiding Guanaja. Cortés at once despatched a caravel
which brought in the vessel with its slaves, destined
for the mines of Cuba and Jamaica. The
commander, Rodrigo de Merlo, exhibited a license for
his expedition, so that severe measures could not well
be taken, but means were found to persuade the captain
to settle at Trujillo with his crew. The kidnapped
islanders were restored to their grateful
friends. They sent in their allegiance and received
letters of protection, together with a number of
swine which soon multiplied on the islands.<a id='FA_XIX-22' href='#FN_XIX-22' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-22]</a>
</p>

<p>
Another instance of the influence of Cortés' name
was afforded by the entry, from Nicaragua into Olancho<a id='FA_XIX-23' href='#FN_XIX-23' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-23]</a>
province, of an expedition under Gabriel de
Rojas, consisting of sixty men with twenty horses.
The natives resisted, no doubt, whereupon Rojas
began to enslave and pillage. A deputation arriving
at Trujillo to implore protection, Sandoval was instructed
to interfere on behalf of the natives, as
subjects of Cortés.<a id='FA_XIX-24' href='#FN_XIX-24' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-24]</a> His force was insufficient, it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_578' href='#Page_578'>578</a></span>
seems, to drive out the intruders, but Rojas nevertheless
retired by order of Córdoba.<a id='FA_XIX-25' href='#FN_XIX-25' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-25]</a>
</p>

<p>
One reason for this withdrawal was that Córdoba
could not afford to place himself in hostile attitude
to any neighbor. One of the acts of Moreno during
his arbitrary proceeding in Honduras had been to
urge upon him to transfer his allegiance and province
to the audiencia. This prompting found a willing
ear. Blind to the accumulative evidence of failure,
and untaught by disappointment, Córdoba allowed
the few instances of successful revolt to overshadow
every failure. He looked upon the force around
him, and measuring the distance between himself and
the grim Pedrarias, his dread grew fainter as the
leagues increased; meanwhile hope kept whispering,
might he not also become another Cortés, borne aloft
by fame, or at least a Velazquez safe upon his usurped
island? He wavered, and yielded. In maturing his
plans for a step so full of risk, he resolved to learn
further from Moreno what authority he possessed, and
perfect arrangements with him. Pedro de Garro<a id='FA_XIX-26' href='#FN_XIX-26' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-26]</a>
was accordingly sent with a party of forty men to
Honduras, bearing also petitions to the emperor and
audiencia, and with instructions to explore the best
route to a port in that province through which supplies
and war material might be procured. Sandoval,
on hearing of their approach, captured them, together
with their retinue of beautiful women and numerous
servants, but allowed a few under escort to proceed to
Trujillo. Cortés received them with good-will, and
as a proof thereof ordered four pack animals to be
sent laden with horseshoes, mining tools, and other
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_579' href='#Page_579'>579</a></span>
articles, as a present to Córdoba. But he could not
countenance the overthrowal of a chief by a subordinate
officer; for had not his present expedition been
made to punish a similar attempt? He wrote him
accordingly, advising fidelity to Pedrarias, and promising
his aid in procuring supplies through Honduras,
since Panamá, was regarded as too distant.<a id='FA_XIX-27' href='#FN_XIX-27' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-27]</a>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">TEMPTATION.</div>

<p>
This intercourse had served to enlighten Cortés in
regard to the condition and resources of the country
to the south and south-west. He had learned that it
was fertile and populous, filled with flourishing towns,
and giving great promise of mineral wealth; facts confirmed
by the splendid retinue of Garro and the demand
for mining implements. Perhaps in this very
country lay the rich provinces which had stirred his
imagination, even before the fall of Mexico, and for
which he had come in search this long way. Should
he allow an interloper to deprive him of what his
fancy had claimed all these years, and what had enticed
him to superhuman efforts? But a valid excuse
was needed for seizing a province already held by another,
a king's lieutenant like himself. Cortés was too
astute, however, not to find a way to prevent so rich
a prize from eluding him. Was it out of friendship
for a stranger that he had sent valuable presents to
Córdoba, and offered to forward supplies through Honduras?
No, he knew where to sow in order to reap.
He had also written, as he admits, to some officers in
Nicaragua whom he knew, and what subtle poison
may not have been diffused by craftily worded advice.
Córdoba understood the hint for himself, and was confirmed
in his resolve. But his fellow-soldiers had also
a word to say. The idea of risking life and fortune
for the ambitious plans of a captain who was little,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_580' href='#Page_580'>580</a></span>
if anything, more than themselves, was by no means
to the liking of all the officers. Several objected, and
since it was now too late to retreat Córdoba must even
persuade them by arms. Civil war threatened, and
the news was not long in reaching Trujillo. Indeed, it
seems that the rebel leader, on finding what a tempest
he had invoked, sent to tender allegiance to Cortés.<a id='FA_XIX-28' href='#FN_XIX-28' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-28]</a>
And then the latter reasoned with himself. Could
he, an imperial officer, stand calmly by and see his
Majesty's interests sacrificed and his subjects, his
countrymen, slaughtered? No, certainly not; and he
congratulated himself upon the success of his plans.
Here was the longed-for pretence, cast in his way by
fortune. He must pounce upon the prize while the
claimants were absorbed in contention.<a id='FA_XIX-29' href='#FN_XIX-29' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-29]</a> The first
step was to direct a large force of natives to open a
road to Nicaragua, and Sandoval received orders to
prepare for the expedition.<a id='FA_XIX-30' href='#FN_XIX-30' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-30]</a>
</p>

<p>
Again it seemed as if the great leader had misinterpreted
the signs of providence.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">ASSUMES GREATER POMP.</div>

<p>
His messenger to Mexico had safely arrived, and
with prudent management a reaction had been started
in favor of Cortés; the evidence that he was alive
was half the battle; but his enemies, though checked,
were not overthrown, and believing that everything
depended upon his presence it was decided to recall
him. The commission was intrusted to his cousin,
Fray Diego Altamirano, an ex-soldier who had doffed
the helmet for a Franciscan cowl, and a man of honor
and business talent.<a id='FA_XIX-31' href='#FN_XIX-31' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-31]</a> He fell like a bomb-shell on
the manifold projects of Cortés for conquest and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_581' href='#Page_581'>581</a></span>
aggrandizement, which, if encouraged by one success,
might have borne the victor triumphantly southward,
perhaps to the realms of the Incas. Altamirano was
not a man to let the stern present be obscured by the
glowing fancies of enthusiasm. His visions turned
alone toward Mexico, and his coloring was reserved
for painting the sad condition of its affairs. This he
did, boldly, yet with loving discreetness, and convinced
his kinsman that return to Mexico was absolutely
necessary to save himself, his friends, and the
country from ruin. He also insisted that in order
to succeed in controlling followers he must assert his
dignity, and impose on the vulgar by an intimidating
and awe-inspiring pomp. The familiarity grown out
of the fellowship of the camp and the toil of the
march might answer in a border province, but not
in the well-settled districts of New Spain, or at the
court of Mexico. More dignity should be assumed
at once; here and now must he teach his followers
the distance between the governor and the subject,
and demand reverence as his due. There was not
much need for exhortation in this respect, for pomp
came naturally to Cortés. Readily, therefore, did he
mount the gubernatorial seat with its imposing dais,
and receive with a complacent smile the <i>señoría</i><a id='FA_XIX-32' href='#FN_XIX-32' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-32]</a> from
the lips of the deeply bowing suite. In church, even,
he occupied the higher level of the raised <i>sitial</i>,<a id='FA_XIX-33' href='#FN_XIX-33' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-33]</a>
while abroad the cannon belched forth in his honor.<a id='FA_XIX-34' href='#FN_XIX-34' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-34]</a>
</p>

<p>
His distrust of the sea remained, and he determined
to return through Guatemala. The laborers,
therefore, were taken from the Nicaragua road to
prepare the way for him;<a id='FA_XIX-35' href='#FN_XIX-35' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-35]</a> but finally the pilots convinced
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_582' href='#Page_582'>582</a></span>
him that at this season of the year the winds
and currents were favorable, while the land route
must be long and full of obstacles. He accordingly
embarked in three vessels with twenty Spanish followers
and their horses, and some two hundred Indians
under Prince Ixtlilxochitl, setting sail April 25,
1526.<a id='FA_XIX-36' href='#FN_XIX-36' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-36]</a> Sandoval joined him, but his company went
overland. Saavedra remained as his lieutenant, with
instructions to maintain native loyalty by good treatment,
and to promote settlement. The general's yet
wavering confidence in the sea received another shock
off the very coast of New Spain, whence a gale drove
him back and compelled him to seek refuge in Cuba.
On the 16th of May he again set sail, and landed a
week later near the present Vera Cruz. The news
of his arrival spread rapidly, and soldiers, colonists,
and natives hastened forward in throngs to bear the
beloved leader, the mighty Malinche, in triumph to
the island city which he had won and refounded.
Doubts were dissipated and past disappointments
forgotten as he gazed once more on the scenes of his
brilliant achievements, and drank the plaudits of the
multitude.<a id='FA_XIX-37' href='#FN_XIX-37' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-37]</a>

<div class="sidenote">CÓRDOBA MEDITATES.</div>

<p>
With the departure of Cortés in drooping plumes,
his pretentious projects for dominion in the south
received a check, and the portentous clouds which
had before loomed over Honduras again darkened the
sky, extending over the adjoining lake province, there
to threaten Córdoba's bright visions of independence.
One can hardly blame the lieutenant for indulging
his imagination with the alluring prospects of power,
wealth, and fame, when kept in subjection on the one
side by so unlovable a master as Pedrarias, and when
prompted on the other by the powerful audiencia of
Santo Domingo to cast off the unrighteous allegiance.
With his mind thus predisposed, Córdoba saw clearly
that Nicaragua could not permanently pertain to the
jurisdiction of Panamá. It was a distinct province,
conquered and abandoned by Gil Gonzalez, and now
brought into resubjection by his own efforts and talents.
If any one disputed his position he could point
to the authorization of the audiencia. True, the fleet
and men, the means and influence, used in effecting
the reconquest pertained to his late chief. What of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_585' href='#Page_585'>585</a></span>
that? The ships did not belong to Pedrarias; the old
governor had taken them in direct disobedience to
the orders of the king. As for the money and the
men, all had been obtained by vile indirection, and
might as well be made to serve one traitor as another.
But he was no traitor to the king who responded to
the will of the king's audiencia.
</p>

<p>
There was much in common between the revolts of
Olid and Córdoba, but the motives of the leaders
differed. The former, bold, brave, and in the main
true, had felt aggrieved that so broad a portion of the
earth should fall to the lot of one man, whose pretensions
thereto grew out of his accidental position as
commander, while he, a captain who had shared every
danger and hardship in the grand conquest, must be
content forever to serve. The sole command of a
small portion of disputed territory he had deemed a
recompense small enough beside the imperial reward
of his commander. Hernandez de Córdoba viewed
matters from a somewhat different stand-point, though
with an abundance of plausible excuses. He was an
instrument chosen by Pedrarias to wrest a fair domain
from the rightful conqueror. In this selection Pedrarias
had been governed by his usual narrow policy.
Throughout his whole career he could not abandon
the vain attempt to accomplish great results by small
means, and noble results by base means.
</p>

<p>
With such incentives and precepts Córdoba found
little difficulty in disposing of the moral obstacles to
his scheme, and on turning toward the material he
saw nothing insurmountable, since most of the men
were favorably disposed. In this there was nothing
strange, for Córdoba was generous and confiding, and
by the side of Pedrarias such qualities shone with
double lustre. As a first step he called on the settlers,
particularly of Leon and Granada, to petition the
king for his appointment as independent governor.<a id='FA_XX-1' href='#FN_XX-1' class='fnanchor'>[XX-1]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_586' href='#Page_586'>586</a></span>
None objected save a dozen men headed by the captains
Soto and Compañon. Loyalty had probably
nothing to do with their opposition, but rather jealousy.
They would not risk their liberty and prospects
to raise so much above themselves a fellow officer
who could never be in their eyes more able and deserving
than themselves.
</p>

<p>
The remonstrances of these few persons were not
to be regarded, however, and retreat for Córdoba was
in any case too late. Soto, the first to object, was
cast into the fortress of Granada, but Compañon,
with a few faithful comrades, broke open the prison
and liberated him. The little band, well armed and
mounted, then took the field against Córdoba and
openly bade him defiance. Córdoba recognized that
prompt action was indispensable, and set forth in
pursuit. Though Soto and Compañon failed to gain
more adherents, as they had expected, they nevertheless
took a stand near Granada against the usurper's
formidable force, warning him that all their efforts,
in case of attack, would be concentrated on killing
him.<a id='FA_XX-2' href='#FN_XX-2' class='fnanchor'>[XX-2]</a> The lieutenant hesitated. He well knew
the determined character of his late officers, and
pictured himself the target of their unerring missiles.
The golden visions of his hopes became dimmer. He
would like to be a governor, but he did not wish to
be killed; and not possessing the spirit of greatness,
he readily found an excuse for returning whence he
came, while Soto with his gallant ten thought it profitable
to acquaint Pedrarias and receive from him
the reward of loyal servants. The journey back to
Panamá was not easy, with its rugged mountains,
impetuous streams, and pathless forests, while hostile
natives, venomous animals, and gnawing hunger added
to the hardships serious danger; nevertheless they
would undertake it, and make a portion of their way
by sea. Soon after starting they found their horses
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_587' href='#Page_587'>587</a></span>
an encumbrance rather than an aid, and therefore
they abandoned them. Barefooted and dilapidated
they reached the town of Fonseca,<a id='FA_XX-3' href='#FN_XX-3' class='fnanchor'>[XX-3]</a> in Chiriquí, where
Hurtado, the founder, relieved them, and provided a
canoe in which to pursue the journey.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">SOTO AND HURTADO.</div>

<p>
After the departure of Soto southward, the good
Hurtado pondered over the situation. The rebel
Córdoba, in common with Soto and the others, he
held in low esteem. If with his small force he could
not conquer him, he believed he could frighten the
man greatly; at all events, here was an opportunity
to gain favor with Pedrarias. He accordingly armed
all the able-bodied men at his command and marched
against the rebels, leaving the sick and helpless to
ward off famine and the natives as best they might.
After waiting some time in vain for the return of
Hurtado, the abandoned remnant deserted the post
and set out in search of him, directing their steps
toward the gulf of Nicoya.
</p>

<p>
In the mean time Soto and his party reached Natá
and sent their report to Panamá. Rage in the breasts
of some men consumes both body and soul; but such
was the nature of Pedrarias that the essence of his
life appeared to be drawn from inexhaustible wells of
vindictive spleen. Although approaching the time
when most men die, the castigation of a traitorous
lieutenant was too choice a morsel to intrust to
another; and so, belting in his wrath, he prepared at
once to march against him. To this he was impelled
also by a desire to forestall any attempt on the part
of the conqueror of Mexico, whose projects were even
then casting a portentous shadow over the smiling
shores of the Freshwater Sea. A still deeper impulse,
however, was the looming spectre of a new
governor, with orders for a residencia, which once
instituted might prevent his departure.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_588' href='#Page_588'>588</a></span>
</p>

<p>
To defray the expenses of the expedition Pedrarias
was obliged not only to employ his own fortune but
to borrow large sums from the house-holders and
merchants. This he did, agreeing to share with them
the profits of the adventure. He was shrewd enough
to conceal how much a prospective successor and residencia
had to do with his departure; and believing
that the object was solely to secure for the benefit
of Panamá, from a strange invader and rebel, the
gold-seamed Nicaragua with its budding colonies and
trade, the people were quite eager to aid him in so
promising and loyal a scheme. Panamá and Natá
had already been drained of able-bodied men by the
expeditions under Pizarro and Almagro which were to
yield such brilliant results, and Pedrarias was obliged
to draw upon Acla and Nombre de Dios for soldiers.
This additional levy so nearly depopulated the province
that its four cities together could hardly muster
occupants enough for 'a mediocre hamlet,' as Oviedo
expresses it. A large number of Indians were also
taken. The departure of the fleet took place in January,
1526.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Córdoba had not been comfortable since Soto's
escape. The more he pondered the shorter to his
mind grew the distance between himself and the
grim Pedrarias. In his fear he bethought himself
of Cortés, and sent to offer him the province on condition
that he should retain the command as his
lieutenant; for it was far better to be subject to
the magnanimous conqueror of Anáhuac, whose name
would prove a safeguard against his old master, while
his distant residence in Mexico might leave a lieutenant
almost wholly independent. This scheme received
an encouraging acceptance, as we have seen,
only to be abandoned before the urgent appeals from
Mexico.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">EXECUTION OF CÓRDOBA.</div>

<p>
The more than peculiar conduct of Córdoba on
meeting Soto has prepared us for almost any pusillanimity
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_589' href='#Page_589'>589</a></span>
on his part. Either a blind reliance in Cortés
made him careless, or the arrival at Leon of the
hoary-headed Pedrarias was unexpectedly sudden; it
seems at any rate that he did not even attempt to
defend himself. Probably the settlers had become
disgusted with his want of courage and failed to support
him. All we learn is that he and his friends
humbly met the governor and sought to deny their
guilt, pleading, as in the case of Vasco Nuñez, that
had mutinous intentions been entertained they would
not thus have dared to come forward unarmed, but
would have fled or defended themselves. The case
was too clear, however, and Pedrarias never forgave:
the head of Córdoba was required as a lesson to similar
aspirants.<a id='FA_XX-4' href='#FN_XX-4' class='fnanchor'>[XX-4]</a>
</p>

<p>
Having thus removed his rebellious subordinate,
Pedrarias looked about to secure the permanent government
of the province and extend his jurisdiction
as best he might. If Nicaragua belonged to Castilla
del Oro, as he of course maintained, so must the
eastern and north-eastern extension of this region,
as far at least as the gulf of Honduras, clearly the
natural boundary. The efforts of Gil Gonzalez to secure
Honduras showed that he had also regarded this
province as pertaining to Nicaragua. But above all,
was not the dreaded Cortés away, and was not his
lieutenant, Saavedra, in command of a mere handful
of men? What more convincing evidence of his right
could there be? But even under these circumstances
caution was necessary, and he resolved to secure at
first only the adjoining border territory. With this
object captains Hurtado and Rojas were sent to occupy
Olancho Valley. The natives had too vivid a
recollection of the former invasion under Rojas to feel
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_590' href='#Page_590'>590</a></span>
safe, and hastened to Trujillo with their complaints.
Saavedra, who saw the danger of countenancing encroachments
from such a quarter, sent two envoys<a id='FA_XX-5' href='#FN_XX-5' class='fnanchor'>[XX-5]</a> to
demand the immediate withdrawal of the Nicaraguan
troops. Pedrarias was not unprepared for this, and
smooth and evasive was his answer. For the sake of
peace he would come to an understanding with Cortés
regarding his pretensions in that quarter, and submit
the whole matter to the decision of the audiencia.
Meanwhile there must be no fighting or attempted
overreaching among countrymen.
</p>

<p>
The tone and manner of the old courtier would have
convinced more experienced men than the Honduras
envoys, and with satisfied hearts they turned to bear
the peaceful message to their chief. Pedrarias gained
his point. He never entertained the idea of writing
to Cortés or submitting any question to the audiencia.
</p>

<p>
Fresh instructions were at once despatched to Hurtado
and Rojas, and while the envoys were lulling
Saavedra into fancied security they fell upon his adherents
in Olancho, routed them, and secured their
effects. The victors then proceeded northward with
a view to occupy Natividad and secure for their chief
a much needed port on the North Sea, through which
to receive supplies and maintain communication with
Spain and the Islands, for the Panamá route was too
long and costly. Informed of their movements Saavedra
sent a force to intercept them. The captains were
not just then prepared to resist so strong a body,
and like their master they resorted to fair words, both
sides promising to return peaceably home. But neither
believed in these assurances, and each resolved to watch
the other. Rojas, for that matter, proceeded on the
march to Natividad, while Hurtado returned to Olancho
to protect his interests there. The Trujillo party
pursued the latter, and a fight ensued wherein they
proved victorious, after losing two men. These broils
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_591' href='#Page_591'>591</a></span>
the natives observed, and saw therein their opportunity.
They attacked Natividad, and the Spaniards,
driven forth after a fight in which several fell, took
refuge in a natural stronghold, there to remain until
aid could arrive.<a id='FA_XX-6' href='#FN_XX-6' class='fnanchor'>[XX-6]</a>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">HURTADO AND GRIJALVA SLAIN.</div>

<p>
Rojas appears to have learned of this uprising in
time to retreat to Olancho; but here also the caciques
had mustered in force<a id='FA_XX-7' href='#FN_XX-7' class='fnanchor'>[XX-7]</a> to avenge the injuries which
Pedrarias' soldiers were inflicting. Ordered by them
to bring in maize and material for houses, they seized
the opportunity to introduce within the bundles a
quantity of arms. These were to serve the natives
who remained in or near the camp waiting the
approach of their regularly armed compatriots. All
prepared, the word was given, and stealthily the dusky
foe crept upon the unsuspecting Spaniards. Living
in the midst of treachery, it seems impossible that
they should have allowed themselves to be thus lulled.
Suddenly forest, hill, and dale were alive with Indians,
and the silence was broken by a piercing yell as the
first victim met his fate. The signal was taken up,
and from thousands came the avenging shriek, reverberating
along the wooded slopes and rolling back
upon the doomed band. Resistance seemed to avail
them little. Sixteen were slain; a few escaped to
a friendly cacique, named Guatucanola; and twenty
horses were lost. The settlement was sacked and
burned. Among the fallen were Captain Hurtado,
who had rendered so many eminent services as
explorer, leader, and founder, and Juan de Grijalva,
a man who, as captain of a Cuban expedition, had
achieved the honor of discovering the Mexican mainland,
and who might even have gained the glory of
that brilliant conquest but for his fine sense of honor
and other manly qualities. Often a too strict integrity
impedes the path to greatness. At all events, these
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_592' href='#Page_592'>592</a></span>
qualities lost him the favor of his master and governor,
Velazquez, and despite his faithful services, his
courage and talent, he was sent forth in disgrace, to
die ignobly in this wilderness.<a id='FA_XX-8' href='#FN_XX-8' class='fnanchor'>[XX-8]</a>
</p>

<p>
Rojas arrived soon after and sought to restore
peace, but the natives were too strong for him, and
for years they held their ground. Saavedra charged
Pedrarias with being the cause of the disaster, and
not without reason, for the treacherous conduct of
his captains had encouraged the uprising. Quarrels
and recriminations followed, but without any attempt
on the part of Saavedra to take active steps against
the Nicaraguan invaders. Finding his adversary so
tame, the old governor felt emboldened to take the
step he had so long been meditating, to secure possession
of the remainder of Honduras. To this effect
he despatched Captain Diego de Albites and Sebastian
de Benalcázar, regidores of Leon, with Notary
Espinosa, to demand the submission of Saavedra and
the cabildo of Trujillo to his jurisdiction. The envoys
were hardly on their way, however, before tidings
came from Panamá which sent Pedrarias in all haste
back to the Isthmus, leaving the government in the
joint charge of several of his most trusted officers,
among whom Martin Estete figured as lieutenant-general.<a id='FA_XX-9' href='#FN_XX-9' class='fnanchor'>[XX-9]</a>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">PEDRO DE LOS RIOS.</div>

<p class="p2">
The new governor of Castilla del Oro, Pedro de los
Rios, had arrived with his fleet at Nombre de Dios July
30, 1526,<a id='FA_XX-10' href='#FN_XX-10' class='fnanchor'>[XX-10]</a> attended, as was common in such cases,
by many followers, among whom were Licenciado
Juan de Salmeron, alcalde mayor; Bachiller Diego de
Corral; Diego Gutierrez de los Rios, a nephew, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_593' href='#Page_593'>593</a></span>
Egas, the half-brother of the governor. Oviedo was
also of the party, bearing as his reward for procuring
the change of rule the appointment of captain-general
and governor of the province of Cartagena. The
day following the arrival the new officials were sworn
in, and within four weeks they had taken up their
residence at Panamá. The jurisdiction of Rios covered
the same territory as had that of Pedrarias,
excepting Paria and Veragua. As usual, he had been
particularly enjoined to look to the good treatment
of the Indians and promote the formation of towns
on healthy sites. In all matters of importance he
was to consult with the alcalde mayor, as a man
learned in the law, and a faithful servant of the king.
The governor was empowered to settle all disputes
and punish all crimes according to his judgment and
the laws of the country, and with regard to thieves
and robbers he was recommended to go even somewhat
beyond the law. This was a power admirably
suited for a reformer as Rios came heralded, but the
rising rejoicings of the people at the removal of the
old governor began quickly to calm on finding, as
Oviedo says, that in the place of one hydra head cut
off two others had appeared.<a id='FA_XX-11' href='#FN_XX-11' class='fnanchor'>[XX-11]</a>
</p>

<p>
Pedro de los Rios was quite a different man from
Pedrarias; indeed we shall scarcely again in this history
meet the equal of the old governor of Darien.
Though possessing more bulk of body the new governor
lacked the strength of mind of the old one;
he lacked the cunning, indomitable energy, and the
vindictive pertinacity of Pedrarias. He loved gold,
however, in which predilection he was joined by his
wife, who even surpassed him in this respect. In
accordance with royal orders, among his first acts
were to seize the effects and estates of Pedrarias,
including his encomiendas, to secure control of the
Pearl Islands and their revenues, and to hold all
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_594' href='#Page_594'>594</a></span>
until the residencia of the outgoing governor was
taken. Pedrarias knew that his authority at Panamá
was lost, but he did not like to lose his property. It
was a pecuniary disaster alone that could have taken
him from Nicaragua at this critical moment.
</p>

<p>
The news of his coming was brought by a vessel
laden with kidnapped Nicaraguans, to be sold by
auction in the Panamá market. He himself reached
Natá in December, and after writing to Rios made
his appearance at the capital February 3, 1527.
Three days later the residencia was proclaimed by
Salmeron.
</p>

<p>
Not knowing who the judges might be, Pedrarias
had taken the precaution to petition the India Council
for power of appeal in any decision which might be
rendered against him. And this had been granted,
with the order to pay at once any judgment under
ten thousand maravedís, and to make a deposit which
should cover all amounts of larger claims. Further
than this, he had taken with him to Nicaragua, and
had left there, those who might most trouble him in
his residencia. The greater part of the aggrieved
were thus out of the way, and their opportunity
lost.
</p>

<p>
He had also despatched Enciso to Spain, to represent
his interests at court and neutralize the machinations
of his enemies. The result was the arrival of a cédula
from the king just in time to provide that no questions
were to be raised in the present residencia touching
matters disposed of by the pretended investigations
under Alarconcillo. This reduced still further the
complaints against Pedrarias, and as he at once made
overtures to his judge, sparing neither money nor
humility, and as he still had influence, his feebly presented
crimes were lightly regarded. Oviedo deemed
himself exceedingly ill used in these proceedings, and
loudly chronicles his complaints. After presenting a
long list of claims, which were denied, the historian
was glad to escape assassination at the hand of his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_595' href='#Page_595'>595</a></span>
ancient enemy.<a id='FA_XX-12' href='#FN_XX-12' class='fnanchor'>[XX-12]</a> Charges of course were sent to
Spain,<a id='FA_XX-13' href='#FN_XX-13' class='fnanchor'>[XX-13]</a> citing instances of abuse of power, and of
private frauds. Among the more serious accusations
was the embezzling of royal moneys, which had
helped to swell a remittance of seventy thousand
pesos de oro, sent secretly to a safe receptacle in
Spain. So pressing and puzzling were these charges
that the India Council held repeated consultations on
the case.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">BEFORE THE INDIA COUNCIL.</div>

<p>
But Pedrarias had not been idle. He had requested
his powerful relatives to hold forth to the
king himself, to the best advantage, the many valuable
services he had rendered in Africa as well as in
the Indies. The words of the agent Enciso were
likewise powerful, and made these records stand out
resplendent, backed as they were with the dazzling
treasures of the Pearl Islands.<a id='FA_XX-14' href='#FN_XX-14' class='fnanchor'>[XX-14]</a> Not only was Pedrarias
acquitted and reinstated in his rights and
possessions, but new favors were showered on him.
Yet the government of Panamá could not be restored
to him; indeed the crown itself had not been
so blinded as some of its satellites to the many evils
that had characterized the government of Pedrarias
in Castilla del Oro. At all events it was considered
timely to allow the oppressed province to recover
from the selfish tyranny of his rule under a more
fatherly supervision. His shrewd foresight and usual
good fortune were paving a new way, however. It
so happened that Gil Gonzalez, the rightful claimant
to Nicaragua, died about the time that Pedrarias
sent in to the king a glowing report on the resources
of this province, together with promises of great
revenues. Not only was he now entitled to the first
consideration for the post of governor, but it was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_596' href='#Page_596'>596</a></span>
probably considered advantageous to the royal purse
that a man of such natural proclivities for extortion
should be given a field where watchful energy alone
was needed to develop untold wealth. Again was the
star of Pedrarias emerging from behind the Hyperborei
Montes, but with lustre dimmed by clouds rising,
this time in the direction of Honduras.

</p>

<p>
One of the chief causes which gave rise to the disputes
of rival leaders for the occupancy of Nicaragua
and Honduras was the policy which governed the
Council of the Indies in regard to the colonial possessions
of Spain. Gradually the discovery of Columbus
had assumed gigantic proportions, and the indefinite
and unknown limits to the territories which had been
given to the first governors were becoming more fixed
and determined. The immense extent of the discovery
and the vast dominions which had been allotted
to each colony was then first ascertained. It was
deemed wise and prudent by the court of Spain that
such broad possessions should be divided into smaller
states, and governed by many, rather than that the
whole should be under the jurisdiction of a few arrogant
viceroys. Thus checks could be more easily
placed on individuals, and the distant provinces of the
New World could be more readily held in subjection.
With this in view it was that Hernandez de Córdoba
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_598' href='#Page_598'>598</a></span>
had been urged by the audiencia to throw off allegiance
to Pedrarias, and that the enterprises not only
of Gil Gonzalez but of Olid had been encouraged by
the Spanish government.<a id='FA_XXI-1' href='#FN_XXI-1' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-1]</a>
</p>

<p>
But a resort to arms as a method for settling their
differences was by no means desired; and when the
emperor became aware that hostilities had broken out
among the colonists of Honduras and Nicaragua he
peremptorily forbade any Spaniard to draw his sword
against another, under penalty of his severe displeasure.
The better to curb the encroaching conquerors
on either side, and to further his policy, he
resolved to appoint new governors for these provinces;
and thus it was that Pedrarias, owing in a great
measure to his wife and to family influence, had obtained
the long desired lake region, even before the
result of his residencia was known; while Honduras
was given as early as 1525<a id='FA_XXI-2' href='#FN_XXI-2' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-2]</a> to Diego Lopez de Salcedo,
regardless of the great efforts and means expended
by Cortés in its colonization, wholly from his
own resources.<a id='FA_XXI-3' href='#FN_XXI-3' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-3]</a>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">SAAVEDRA AND SALCEDO.</div>

<p>
Salcedo was at this time residing in Española, and
on receiving the appointment, together with instructions
to inquire into the late trouble and punish the
guilty, he at once prepared to set out. The audiencia
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_599' href='#Page_599'>599</a></span>
also took the instructions to heart, and, regarding
Cortés as implicated, they seized one of his ships at
Santo Domingo, with its cargo of merchandise.<a id='FA_XXI-4' href='#FN_XXI-4' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-4]</a> Salcedo
found the settlers at peace on reaching Trujillo.
Saavedra and Alcalde Figueroa set the example to
the other officials in doing reverence to the new ruler,
who was solemnly inaugurated on the 27th of October,
1526.<a id='FA_XXI-5' href='#FN_XXI-5' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-5]</a> The first act under the new régime was to
make an investigation into the late political disturbances,
and the result was the arrest of Saavedra,
regidores Garnica and Vega, and two settlers named
Martin Cortés and Morales, who were placed on a
vessel for transmission to the judges in Española.
Their safe-keeping was intrusted to Diego Morillo,
who was installed with a staff of justice, to give him
greater authority. But the emblem of the law failed
to impose upon the prisoners, who were in this respect
hardly less imbued with the spirit of the times than
Pedrarias and his followers. They had too wholesome
a fear of the quality of mercy dispensed by the
pompous rulers at Santo Domingo, and determined to
make an effort for liberty. The mainland had barely
been lost to sight when they appealed to the master's
sympathy. Their argument was sufficiently weighted
to be convincing, and the shackles were not only
transferred to Morillo, but he was relieved of all his
effects. The vessel's course was thereupon changed
to Cuba, where the mutineers dispersed in search of
wider spheres of operations.<a id='FA_XXI-6' href='#FN_XXI-6' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-6]</a>
</p>

<p>
Shortly after Salcedo's installation the three envoys
of Pedrarias arrived at Trujillo. Finding a royal
governor instead of the intruder Saavedra, they did
not venture to present their demands for the submission
of the province, but sought instead to regain
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_600' href='#Page_600'>600</a></span>
Nicaragua and warn their master. Salcedo had them
arrested, however, as concerned in the disorders in
Nicaragua and Olancho, and turned the tables by declaring
Pedrarias an arraigned culprit, answerable to
the residencia judge at Panamá, and Nicaragua as
falling within the jurisdiction of Honduras, instead of
pertaining to Castilla del Oro. He intended, in fact,
to take possession at once, and in this course he was
encouraged by petitions from the anti-Pedrarias faction
of that province. The limits of Salcedo's government
had not been fixed, and what more natural
than to base on the claims of Cortés and Gonzalez
the pleasing illusion that Nicaragua must belong to
his jurisdiction? An additional excuse was to be found
in the late political disturbances in that province,
which it behooved him as a royal officer to stop.
The captive envoys should accompany him as guides
and hostages.
</p>

<p>
Preparations were soon concluded, and Salcedo departed
with nearly one hundred and fifty horsemen,
leaving the small remnant at Trujillo under command
of Francisco de Cisneros.<a id='FA_XXI-7' href='#FN_XXI-7' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-7]</a> He sent forward Alonso de
Solis, one of his captains, and a priest, with instructions
to report to him the condition of the Indians throughout
the district; whether they were friendly or otherwise;
and what were their feelings in regard to the Christian
faith which they had previously professed to adopt.
Solis speedily came back with the information that
bands of Spaniards were prowling about the Olancho
Valley. Salcedo advanced upon them, and a skirmish
ensued in which two men were lost. Suspecting that
Albites and his companions might be connected with
this untoward check, he sent them back to Trujillo
with instructions for their immediate transmission to
Santo Domingo, on the charge of inciting native
revolts and other disorders. These charges were not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_601' href='#Page_601'>601</a></span>
sustained, however, and the prisoners soon returned
fully exonerated.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">WOES OF THE NATIVES.</div>

<p>
Still another check came to dampen the ardor of
the party, and Treasurer Castillo, among others, urged
the abandonment of the expedition; but the fair shores
of the Freshwater Sea had taken too deep a hold
upon Salcedo's fancy, strewn as they were by rumor
with much gold. No; he knew his duty as royal
officer, and would extend his beneficent rule to this
region. As for his losses and disappointments, he
would look to that universal source of redress, the
natives. Caciques were summoned to furnish Indians
for carrying burdens and gathering food, and soldiers
went forth to enforce the order. A number of those
suspected of complicity in the disturbances at Natividad
were hanged and others enslaved, to be eventually
sent out of the country and sold. Great were
their woes. Those who lost their relatives or near
friends fled to the mountains, preferring starvation
and death to the cruel oppression of the strangers.
This feeling extended also to the district of Comayagua,
and created a distrust which was at once magnified
into revolt. The Spaniards immediately fell
upon them, and a terrible havoc ensued. The natives
resorted to the passive retaliation of withdrawing
supplies, and even of destroying the crops, so as to
leave the Spaniards without food, and compel them to
devour horses and dogs. This heightened the feeling
against them, and even the carriers were made to
suffer so severely that many threw off their loads and
sought to escape, only to be overtaken and slaughtered.
The panic spread, and tribes distant from the
scene burned their villages and fields to seek refuge in
the mountains, lest they should be exposed to similar
outrages on Salcedo's return.
</p>

<p>
In Nicaragua the rumor of these doings had impelled
the natives to assume a threatening attitude,
so that when the Spanish party finally arrived at
the city of Leon they were hailed as saviors. This
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_602' href='#Page_602'>602</a></span>
helped to pave the way for Salcedo, and when he submitted
his commission to Martin Estete, the officer
in charge, and to the municipal body, they gave one
glance at the sturdy forces by his side and then recognized
it as valid. The new governor was sworn
in May 7, 1527. Once in undisputed possession the
humanity of Salcedo underwent a change. He would
no longer carry panic into native villages by means
of raiding parties; nay, he would even relieve the
Indians from the oppression of their present masters,
the late subjects of Pedrarias, and place them under
the experienced control of his friends and followers.
Without more ado the choice repartimientos were
transferred to the hands of himself and his adherents,
with not even an attempted excuse to the late holders.
Such high-handed proceedings created general dissatisfaction,
not only among the despoiled settlers but
also among the enslaved, who were regarded as cattle,
and treated with a severity paralleled only by the
Honduras atrocities. More spirited, however, than
the former victims, they retaliated with sullen stubbornness,
and refused to gather gold or perform agricultural
labor. The distress increased, and many
could not procure the common necessaries of life.
The rupture between the two races developed into
open warfare, in which rights, grievances, and passion
often figured only as minor impulses by the side
of the cravings of hunger.<a id='FA_XXI-8' href='#FN_XXI-8' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-8]</a>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">PEDRARIAS AND RIOS.</div>

<p class="p2">
To these distressing straits was the country reduced
when a new claimant to the government presented
himself, in the person of Pedro de los Rios. Invested
with the same power and authority over Castilla del
Oro as his predecessor, he thought himself entitled
to jurisdiction also over Nicaragua, since it had been
occupied and settled under the same auspices. He
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_603' href='#Page_603'>603</a></span>
had deferred his departure from Panamá till Pedrarias
should have been securely entangled in the meshes
of his residencia, and therefore unable to object. But
the latter was desirous to see him leave, in the hope
that a change in his own favor might be effected, perhaps
by some friendly ingulfing wave, some devoted
assassin, or some native treachery; for the road was
new and Rios inexperienced. As a proof of his
friendly interest in the project Pedrarias counselled
him to invest heavily in merchandise, which must pay
a large profit. Such advice was not to be disregarded,
and, as circumstances would have it, the gubernatorial
trader was received with open arms by the sorely
pressed settlers of Nicaragua. But Rios had not the
foresight which characterized Fiscal Moreno's proceedings
in Honduras, two years before, and on presenting
his claims to the supreme office the colonists
returned a cold stare. They saw nothing in his commission
which expressly included Nicaragua within
Castilla del Oro, and although much afflicted by the
avaricious and oppressive measures of Salcedo, they
determined to support a governor whom they might
call their own rather than submit to one residing at
such a distance, and evidently intent on enriching
himself and Panamá at their expense.
</p>

<p>
It is not improbable that the cause for the change
lay partly with Pedrarias, whose emissaries hoped by
this means to embroil the new aspirant with his proposed
subjects. Salcedo was strong enough, however,
with his own troops to dictate terms to his rival, and
he peremptorily ordered him to leave the province
within three days, under a penalty of ten thousand
pesos. Rios had too much respect for his portly
person to expose it to profane usage. Still he would
have lingered had not the threatened fine urged him
away. As it was, in the flurry of departure he even
forgot his gout, with which he was just then severely
stricken, and his groans were not resumed till the
vessel had turned prow for Panamá. He carried one
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_604' href='#Page_604'>604</a></span>
consolation, however, to soothe his ruffled spirit; he
had made these boorish colonists pay tenfold for his
cargo of merchandise. After all, the trip had not
proved unprofitable, and he laughed within himself at
the thought. On his way back he stopped at Brusélas,
in the gulf of Nicoya, where a friendly reception
was accorded him. Informed of this, Salcedo with
vindictive jealousy sent a troop of sixty horse under
Garabito to destroy the hospitable town.
</p>

<p>
The rankest despot could hardly deport himself with
more capricious severity than these petty upstart
lieutenants in the Indies. Salcedo was evidently a
fitting successor to Pedrarias, as far as displaying his
jealousy, greed, and cruelty; but he lacked some of
the commanding characteristics which had so often
enabled the latter to weather the storm raised by his
tyrannous impulses. His rule was to be brief and
ignoble. One of his last acts, which bore the relieving
stamp of a public measure, was to order
Gabriel de Rojas to explore Rio San Juan, the outlet
of the lake, and to found there a settlement.
</p>

<p>
This order was disregarded, for just then came the
rumor that Pedrarias was about to return as governor.
This sufficed to bring the general dissatisfaction with
Salcedo to an issue. At first he treated the news as
absurd; but, when the report came that Pedrarias was
actually on the way with a royal commission, he resolved
to collect his scattered followers and make his
escape. The step was fatal, as it encouraged the still
wavering Estete with his friends to pronounce in favor
of the expected chief. The officials of Salcedo were
arrested, which rendered the executive powerless to
act, and his horses were seized, so that he might not
escape a reckoning. So ominous became the demonstration
against the deposed governor, that he abandoned
the building which had hitherto given him
shelter, and sought the protecting walls of the
church. There he remained, closely guarded by the
rebels, till Pedrarias arrived. Several persons had remonstrated
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_605' href='#Page_605'>605</a></span>
with Estete with regard to these arbitrary
proceedings, based as they were on a mere report from
Panamá; but this officer, who had everything to gain
by the movement if the report proved true, declared
that Pedrarias should be supported even if he came
without a royal Commission. In any case it would be
suicidal now to restore the relentless Salcedo to
power.<a id='FA_XXI-9' href='#FN_XXI-9' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-9]</a>
</p>

<p>
All doubts were solved by the arrival of the old
governor at Leon in March, 1528, and the timely
turncoats were liberally rewarded; Estete receiving
the command of Leon, and Diego de Tejorina that
of Granada. Immediately on receipt of his appointment
Pedrarias had hastened to Nicaragua, leaving
an agent at Panamá to finish his residencia, and to
collect the property and effects which had been attached.
In connection with the new government the
king had appointed Licenciado Castañeda alcalde
mayor, and Diego de la Tobilla treasurer, both of
whom arrived eight months later.<a id='FA_XXI-10' href='#FN_XXI-10' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-10]</a>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">IMPRISONMENT OF SALCEDO.</div>

<p>
Salcedo's case claimed the first attention of the
new ruler, and claims and charges began to pour in,
the chief accusation being that he had stationed
spies to watch for the arrival of Pedrarias and native
assassins to despatch him. An investigation was
ordered, to embrace also the question whether Salcedo
had royal authority for his entry into the territory.
The accused denied the charges, of course, and
protested that he had come merely to pacify the
country, in accordance with his instructions. He demanded
liberty to depart for Honduras, where the
king required his presence as governor. Any other
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_606' href='#Page_606'>606</a></span>
person might have felt awed by a demand coupled so
plausibly with the royal name, but Pedrarias had too
often mocked even the direct commands of his sovereign
to care for indirect requirements. He flaunted
in the face of the accused the royal order lately received
forbidding him to meddle in Nicaraguan affairs,
and declared that since he had done so there was
every prospect for a residencia. The order for it
might arrive at any moment, and he must give bonds
to answer the claims against him. The bonds not
being forthcoming he was placed under restraint, and
on his attempting to escape, close confinement was
imposed.
</p>

<p>
Ten weary months Salcedo lay in durance. Finally
Treasurer Tobilla and Osorio, afterward bishop, intervened
and brought about a peaceful settlement.
But the conditions extorted from him as the price
of liberty were so humiliating that shame and vexation
preyed upon his mind, and destroyed his health,
already weakened by imprisonment. He was obliged
to renounce his claims to the south, and promise to
confine himself to a triangular section of territory
bounded on the east and west by Cape Gracias á Dios
and Puerto de Caballos.<a id='FA_XXI-11' href='#FN_XXI-11' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-11]</a> The three envoys of
Pedrarias, whom he had sent to Española to answer
false charges, and who had returned acquitted, were
to be compensated, and he must give security for
twenty thousand pesos to appear in case a residencia
should be instituted against him. On Christmas eve,
1528, the prison doors opened before him, and the
once dashing Salcedo tottered forth, pale and emaciated,
weighed down with infirmities of body and
mind, an object of pity even to the down-trodden
Indians. It had been a game of rogue against rogue,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_607' href='#Page_607'>607</a></span>
and Pedrarias as usual was the winner. Salcedo felt
that he deserved little sympathy, either from the oppressed
colonists or from the cruelly treated natives,
and within ten days he set out for the shielding
precincts of his own government.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">EXPLORATION OF THE RIVER SAN JUAN.</div>

<p class="p2">
Pedrarias had long before this taken steps to secure
for himself the large tracts of country which he intended
to extort from his prisoner, chiefly because
they were reported to be rich in gold. For this there
were also additional motives. The report of mineral
wealth in the province had induced the king to inquire
regarding the desirability of erecting smelting works,
and similar measures, and although the avaricious old
governor required no incentive to gold-hunting, yet
the communication was welcomed as a good pretence
for his preparations. The already projected expedition
by Rojas to the river outlet of the lake was therefore
ordered to proceed, reinforced to more than one hundred
and fifty men, but the chief command was intrusted
to Estete, with instructions to explore the
country, particularly for minerals, to take possession
for Pedrarias, and to found settlements on the river
and along the sea-shore, as desired by the king. On
the river, where it receives the waters of the lake, was
formed the settlement of Nueva Jaen, flushed at first
with brilliant anticipations of a vast entrepôt trade
and a flourishing colony, but doomed to speedy abandonment.
From the mouth of the San Juan the
party followed the coast northward, blazing their way
with branding-iron and sword, and finding good mines
at Cape Gracias á Dios, as rumored. There they established
another colony, of which Rojas was left in
charge, while Estete returned to Leon.
</p>

<p>
Their pathway thither had been stained sanguine
by the most abominable cruelty against the natives,
in the form of wholesale enslavement and wanton
bloodshed, and this in face of the repeated and
stringent orders from the king for their good treatment.<a id='FA_XXI-12' href='#FN_XXI-12' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-12]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_608' href='#Page_608'>608</a></span>
Of what avail were orders which suited not
the taste of Master Pedrarias! On setting out for
Cape Gracias á Dios, Estete received from the chest,
in which it was kept under three locks by order of the
crown, the branding-iron, which was intended to be
used only on rebels and criminals, and pursuing his
circuitous route, he captured and branded indiscriminately
all natives who fell into his hands, and sent
them as slaves to Pedrarias at Leon. Captives were
secured by iron collars around the neck, chained
together in gangs, and forced to carry heavy burdens.
When one fell from exhaustion, in order to save time
and trouble, his head was severed from the body,
and this released the collar so that the others might
pass on.<a id='FA_XXI-13' href='#FN_XXI-13' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-13]</a>
</p>

<p>
This and other kidnapping expeditions, made chiefly
in the interest of Pedrarias, fairly glutted Leon and
Granada with captives; but if they could not be used
here there was another means of utilizing them. The
native population of the Isthmus, as we have seen,
had already been so greatly reduced by the ever dripping
sword, by the hardly less speedy measures of
relentless taskmasters, and by the flight of panic-stricken
border tribes, that the settlers found it difficult
to fill the constantly occurring gaps in their labor
gangs. A slave market had accordingly been opened
at Panamá, where natives were sold by auction. Its
origin was with Pedrarias, and with a fatherly regard
for his former government he felt it a duty to sustain
an institution so useful to the colonists and so comforting
to his coffers. A regular trade thereupon
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_609' href='#Page_609'>609</a></span>
sprang up in Indian slaves, and several ship-loads were
taken down to Panamá about this time by different
persons.<a id='FA_XXI-14' href='#FN_XXI-14' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-14]</a>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEPOPULATION.</div>

<p>
The supply of unfortunates was drawn not only
from the outlying districts, but from the very centre
of the lake settlements, and their capture assisted
the sword and lash to no small extent in decimating
the population. When Gil Gonzalez first entered the
country it was densely populated, and the city of
Managua alone contained forty thousand souls, it was
said. A few years of Spanish rule sufficed to turn
whole tracts of flourishing country into uninhabited
wilds, leaving here and there only small communities
of terrorized natives groaning under extortionate and
cruel masters. On appealing to their idols they were
assured that a flood could be called forth, but in it
would perish Indians as well as Spaniards. Such was
the comfort derived from their religion. Although
they had not courage enough to adopt this remedy,
women widely formed the resolution not to perpetuate
a race foredoomed to slavery and cruel death.
</p>

<p>
At first, when numbers still gave self-reliance, they
ventured to renew the hostilities which under Salcedo
had led to such bloody results. Soon after Estete's
departure for Cape Gracias a general revolt broke out.
In the districts of Leon and Granada bloodshed was
averted, but in the interior the slaughter of natives
was great, and if the Spaniards lost comparatively
few, the loss was increased by the horrors of cannibalism.<a id='FA_XXI-15' href='#FN_XXI-15' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-15]</a>
Among the victims were Alonso Peralta,
the royal treasurer, an hidalgo named Zurita, and two
brothers of the name of Ballas, who in 1528 set out
from the city of Leon to visit the Indians that had
been allotted to them respectively. None ever returned;
all were slain by their vassals. Pedrarias
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_610' href='#Page_610'>610</a></span>
despatched a band of soldiers, who captured eighteen
caciques supposed to be implicated in the murders.
</p>

<p>
The Indians becoming daily more bold and troublesome
a new method of striking them with terror was
invented. As in the introduction of Christianity to
the natives diplomacy was frequently made to take
the place of logic, so in war and punishment a refined
cruelty, in the exercise of which the aged Pedrarias
Dávila stood unexcelled, was deemed the most effectual
means of pacification. The governor of Leon determined
on a grand spectacle, modelled somewhat after
the gladiatorial exhibitions of Rome. An inclosure
was made in the public square of the town, and on a
fixed day the Indian chieftains were brought forth.
One of them was led into the arena and given a stout
stick or club with which to defend his life against the
dogs to be let loose. At first five or six young and
inexperienced animals were set upon him, which he
could easily keep at bay with his stick. After witnessing
this sport until it grew tame, and just as the
unfortunate captive began to rejoice in the hope that
through his skill and bravery his life was saved, two
fierce bloodhounds rushed in, seized him by the throat,
brought him to the ground, tore into shreds the flesh,
and devoured the entrails, assisted by the still yelping
whelps. On the authority of Oviedo, an eye-witness,
this horrible scene was repeated seventeen times.
Pedrarias ordered the dead bodies to be left on the
ground as a warning to others, but soon the stench
became insupportable, and the Indians were allowed
to remove them.<a id='FA_XXI-16' href='#FN_XXI-16' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-16]</a>
</p>

<p class="p2">
Thus did the effort to open a transcontinental route
by way of San Juan not only fail, but it carried a
host of evils with it, as we have seen. Pedrarias was
not content, however, to abandon to Panamá so fruitful
a project without another struggle, and since the
strip of land between Leon and Caballos was well
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_611' href='#Page_611'>611</a></span>
suited for a road, he prepared to open one. But
orders came from the king forbidding the work. The
Isthmus was regarded as sufficient for present traffic,
and it was also feared that too many lives would be
lost in constructing the new road.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">SALVADOR.</div>

<p>
One of the objects of Pedrarias in connection with
the undertaking was to secure possession of the western
territory wrested from Salcedo, and in this, at any
rate, he resolved not to be defeated. Estete was accordingly
despatched northward with a strong force,
accompanied by Rojas. He was first to explore the
northern lakes to determine their outlet, and then to
occupy the district between Golfo Dulce and the
South Sea, north of Fonseca Bay. This province,
known as Salvador, had already been conquered by
Alvarado, the lieutenant of Cortés; but Pedrarias
knew that the settlers left in possession were not
numerous, and that the king would be more apt to
favor the annexation of the province to the adjoining
small government of Nicaragua than to the distant
and too extensive New Spain. Besides, Honduras
had claimed it, and that claim was now his. Estete
advanced into the heart of Salvador and occupied the
town there founded by Alvarado. Few as they were
the settlers refused to recognize the authority of the
Nicaraguan governor, and his lieutenant retired to
the town of Perulapan, upon which he bestowed the
high-sounding title of Ciudad de los Caballeros, together
with a batch of officials who were to aid him
in the congenial task of oppression and enslavement.
His sway was not of long duration, however, for
Jorge de Alvarado, then in charge of the Guatemalan
government, receiving notice of the intrusion, came
down upon his settlement and compelled him to evacuate
the province in hot haste, with the loss of half
his force, which deserted to the enemy.<a id='FA_XXI-17' href='#FN_XXI-17' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-17]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_612' href='#Page_612'>612</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Pedrarias' schemes for aggrandizement were evidently
not succeeding according to his desire, and he
grieved at the thought of the many heavy ducats lost
on this last expedition. It was the more deplorable
in view of the failure to direct through Nicaragua
the transcontinental traffic, which would have yielded
so rich a harvest for himself. But above all hovered
a deeper grief than any of these. Peru, with its glittering
wealth, was now dawning on the world, and
none would have been more dazzled by the sight than
Pedrarias, had not the agonizing fact intruded itself
that he had been tricked out of these very treasures,
or at least a large share of them.
</p>

<p>
When the first expedition was organized for this
conquest by Pizarro, Almagro, and Luque, Pedrarias,
then governor at Panamá, had stipulated for a fourth
interest, in return for which he bestowed the weighty
sum of his patronage. But the opening events proved
to be less flattering than he had expected, and when
demands came for pecuniary aid toward the enterprise,
he shrank from the prospect, and allowed himself
to be bought off for the paltry consideration of
one thousand pesos de oro. Soon came glowing reports,
however, and bitter were his denunciations
of the folly which had permitted so rich a prize to
escape him; and deep his feeling rankled against the
late partners, whom he never ceased to suspect of
duplicity and of having beguiled him with misrepresentation.
</p>

<p>
While he was thus brooding, it happened that Nicolás
de Ribera arrived in Nicaragua, commissioned by
the Peruvian conquerors to procure reinforcements.
He sought in particular to win for this purpose
Hernando de Soto, Hernan Ponce, and Francisco
Compañon, all men of means, who had two vessels on
the stocks, nearly finished and available for the voyage.
By revolving before their eyes, in kaleidoscopic
harmony, a few specimens of the Inca's treasures,
illustrated by tales no less alluring, he secured the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_613' href='#Page_613'>613</a></span>
active sympathy not only of these men, but of a
crowd of beggared adherents.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PERUVIAN ADVENTURE.</div>

<p>
Not least dazzled was Pedrarias. Indeed, he could
not sleep for the visions that crowded upon his brain.
Finally the idea struck him that he might here
retrieve his folly by securing an interest in the vessels
and reinforcements, and obtain a fair proportion of
that gold-enameled region, perhaps the whole. Pizarro
and Almagro had already prepared the way, and it
might even be his fortune to secure the results of
their victories. In order to lull the Peruvian emissaries
he promised to do everything to aid Pizarro
and Luque; as for Almagro, he had been deceived by
him, and deceit his confiding nature could not endure.
He thereupon entered secretly into negotiation with
the owners of the vessels, but overreached himself by
demanding the lion's share in command as well as returns.
Feeling himself in duty bound to spare his
own purse, he looked about for victims to furnish
means, and bethought himself of Ribera's vessel.
An alguacil was sent to seize it, but Ribera received
timely warning and escaped, after prevailing on Ponce,
Soto, and their adherents, to sail away to Panamá and
there arrange with Pizarro for a liberal share in the
conquest, leaving behind the foiled Pedrarias.<a id='FA_XXI-18' href='#FN_XXI-18' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-18]</a>
</p>

<p>
The governor's mortification was increased by local
troubles, as might be expected from his arbitrary
rule and irascible temper, which had now reached
octogenarian crabbedness. A most distasteful feature
had been the arrival of Alcalde Mayor Francisco de
Castañeda, appointed by the king to take charge of
the judicial affairs of the province. This division of
authority was intolerable, and, on the pretence that
disorders must result where different persons exercised
judicial and gubernatorial powers, he urged his friends
in Spain to obtain for him the privilege to appoint and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_614' href='#Page_614'>614</a></span>
remove at pleasure alcaldes mayores and lieutenants.
Meanwhile he made an effort to exercise this power,
alleging the possession of a royal cédula authorizing
him to do so; but Castañeda, who was not so easily
imposed upon, challenged him to produce the document,
and this not being done, he added to his chagrin
by ignoring him.
</p>

<p>
There was little likelihood of any arbitrary powers
being conferred on the governor, for complaints of
abuses were fast pouring in against him, headed by
the influential ayuntamiento of Leon. A grave charge
was peculation. When Rodrigo del Castillo surrendered
his office to the formally appointed treasurer he
took the opportunity to inform the king that large
sums in gold had been taken from the Indians by
Córdoba. All this the governor had laid hands upon
without any accounting therefor to the crown. He
had also managed to appropriate the confiscated estate
of Córdoba, and to defraud a host of others,
besides perpetrating outrages and cruelties of every
description.<a id='FA_XXI-19' href='#FN_XXI-19' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-19]</a>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEATH OF PEDRARIAS.</div>

<p>
In the midst of the brewing troubles, in the year
1530,<a id='FA_XXI-20' href='#FN_XXI-20' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-20]</a> this Timur of the Indies died at Leon, nearly
ninety years of age. His body was buried in the
same church with his victim Hernandez de Córdoba,
and his spirit went to meet the spirit of Vasco
Nuñez, and the spirits of the hundreds of thousands
of slaughtered savages whose benighted souls he had
sent on before.<a id='FA_XXI-21' href='#FN_XXI-21' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-21]</a> Not that he quailed at the thought.
By this time his mind had become so fixed in some
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_615' href='#Page_615'>615</a></span>
incomprehensible mould of logic that there was no
disturbing it. Further than this he knew he could
not escape the inevitable.
</p>

<p>
A disposition so ready to find solace is to be envied,
the more so since it forms a redeeming feature. No
man is, for that matter, wholly depraved, nor are any
faultless. In the worst there is much that is good; in
the best much evil. And the difference between the
best and the worst is, in the eye of the Creator, much
less than in the eye of the creature. For a period of
sixteen years, during the most important epoch in the
history of Darien, an irascible old man, cruel and vindictive,
plays a prominent part. His name is infamous,
and so it deserves to be. Some of his misdeeds
may be attributed to inherent wickedness, others to
infirmities of temper; but many to peculiar conditions
incident to the colonization of a new country, and to
the teachings of the times. Spanish colonists of the
sixteenth century, reared under the influences of excessive
loyalty, and suddenly withdrawn from the
presence of their august sovereign to distant parts,
were like children for the first time freed from the
arbitrary rule of injudicious parents. While the safeguards
of society were removed, and free scope thus
given to passion, there yet remained their religious
belief, the fruit of early teachings. That strange
fanaticism which blended avarice and deeds diabolical
with pretended zeal for the glory of God, not only
permitted but demanded blood and vengeance. Under
the circumstances, therefore, the wonder is, not that
we find so much that is wicked in these Spanish adventurers,
but that men so taught and conditioned
display so many qualities noble and magnanimous.
Farewell Pedrarias! Few there are who came to
these parts of whom so much of evil, so little of good,
may be truthfully said. And thou Death, almighty
leveller! who by thy speedy compensation has brought
this rusty, crusty old man, these several centuries,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_616' href='#Page_616'>616</a></span>
and for all the centuries time shall tell, to be no better
than Vasco Nuñez, than Córdoba, than the meanest
of the multitude of savages he has vilely slain, we
praise thee!<a id='FA_XXI-22' href='#FN_XXI-22' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-22]</a>

</p>

<p>
Some time before Olid entered Honduras the attention
of Alvarado was directed toward Guatemala.
Lying between Mexico and Nicaragua, this country
was one of the first links in Cortés' chain of projected
conquests; it was the foreground in the
glowing picture which rumor had painted of the
regions to the south. Here were the greatest of
cities and the finest of palaces, maintained by a
people as numerous and cultured as any in Anáhuac.
A vast table-land, with an Italian climate, made
bright with meandering streams, studded with verdure-fringed
lakes, produced in abundance the choicest
of products, while the mountains and river-beds, in
the ardent imagination of the conquerors, at least,
were veined with gold. Soft sensuous pearls were
distributed by an equally lavish fancy along the shore
bathed by the southern sea.
</p>

<p>
On first touching the borders of New Spain vague
stories had reached Cortés to this effect, and while
captive Montezuma still held sway at Tenochtitlan he
had sought further information. The reports poured
into his ears served only to magnify the mystery
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_618' href='#Page_618'>618</a></span>
and render the allurement irresistible. As soon,
therefore, as the contest with the empire was over
he despatched two small parties southward, and once
again the drama of Vasco Nuñez was performed, once
more was discovered and claimed the boundless ocean,
emblem of infinity, incentive to ever greater deeds, to
ever grander discoveries, "for within it," writes Cortés
to the emperor, "must be found islands rich in gold
and pearls, and precious stones and spices, and many
other secrets and wonderful things, as men of experience
and learning affirm."<a id='FA_XXII-1' href='#FN_XXII-1' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-1]</a>
</p>

<p>
There was more than speculation in this statement,
for the explorers returned with native envoys bearing
gold and pearls and other specimens of riches. Nor
had they failed, in accordance with the Catholic doctrine
of appropriation, as I have intimated, to take
possession of the new shores in the names of their
Catholic majesties, the king and queen of Spain, and
to erect the cross, emblematic of their religion. With
doubled impulse the conquerors now advanced along
the new route opened, and speedily the vast provinces
of Michoacan and Oajaca were overrun. About the
same time Pilot Andrés Niño had stretched the limit
of discovery by sea from the gulf of Nicoya to very
near this parallel,<a id='FA_XXII-2' href='#FN_XXII-2' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-2]</a> disclosing to the world the vastness
of the sea baptized with the blood of Magellan,
and by him endowed with a new name.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">TEHUANTEPEC AND TUTUTEPEC.</div>

<p>
Native envoys were meanwhile entering into Mexico
to lay homage and rich gifts at the feet of the
bearded white chief. Made happy in return with
Castilian trumpery and the gracious condescension
of the demi-gods, they went back to pour into the
ears of their princes the tales impressed upon them
by the strangers, of the power and grandeur of their
king, and of the kindness and vast benefits to be derived
from a submissive alliance with them. Among
the first of the meek and friendly spirits to act upon
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_619' href='#Page_619'>619</a></span>
these reports was the lord of Tehuantepec. Less
credulous was his neighbor of Tututepec, who had
great wealth, and by no means relished the idea of
throwing open his gates to rapacious invaders. He
expostulated with his neighbor, saying that the course
meditated would be ruinous to them all. The two
chieftains had quarrelled before on a less momentous
issue than the present, and it was quite easy for them
to quarrel now, and fight. If the silly lord of Tehuantepec
wished to throw away himself and all his
belongings, it were better they should fall into a
neighbor's hands than to strangers; so he of Tututepec
attacked him and pressed him hard, until the
ruler of Tehuantepec called to Cortés for help.
</p>

<p>
In answer to this request Pedro de Alvarado was
sent to his aid. Leaving Mexico early in 1522, with
a strong force, he swept southward like a whirlwind,
and within a few weeks entered the doomed capital
of Tututepec, captured the chieftain and his heir, and
held them subject to heavy ransom. Nor was this all.
There were rich mines thereabout, so he was told; and
at the sea, into which he entered with brandished
sword to take possession, his eyes feasted on lustrous
pearls. This sealed the fate of the ocean-bordered
realms, and permanent footholds were established, to
serve as <i>nuclei</i> for radiating conquest, and as retreats
for booty-laden raiders. It was on this occasion that
Soconusco was peaceably occupied by the Spaniards.<a id='FA_XXII-3' href='#FN_XXII-3' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-3]</a>
Still more dazzling was the confirmation received
of the wonderful kingdoms of the Quichés and the
Cakchiquels, hitherto invested by distance with the
charm of mystery, but now by proximity disclosing
glimpses of no mean splendor. He found himself, in
fact, not far from the border, and guides being at hand,
he resolved to send two soldiers to investigate, with
instructions to spy out the land and speak of their
king and their religion.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_620' href='#Page_620'>620</a></span>
</p>

<p>
And thus are opened the portals of Guatemala,<a id='FA_XXII-4' href='#FN_XXII-4' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-4]</a> a
region within whose parallels centuries rocked the
cradle of American civilization, now disclosed by
monuments the most imposing of any on the continent.
The history of their origin is hidden in the remote
past, of which only an occasional glimpse is
permitted the investigator. A mighty Maya empire
looms forth under the name of Xibalba, founded perhaps
by Votan, the culture-hero, and centring round
the famous Palenque. A golden age was followed by
long struggles with a growing power, which brought
about its downfall toward the beginning of our era.
The Nahuas now rise into prominence, but some five
centuries later disaster falls also on them, and a general
breaking-up ensues, leading to mighty migrations and
the formation of smaller independent nations, such as
the Toltecs, Chichimecs, and Quichés. After this even
tradition ceases to speak, save in alluding vaguely to a
later foreign immigration. With this come also certain
Toltecs, who, after the downfall of their empire in the
more northerly Anáhuac, seek here an asylum where
once again may bloom the culture that, cradled in this
very region, now returns with invigorating elements.
Mingling with the natives, they stir anew the progress
paralyzed by civil wars, infuse fresh spirit into tottering
institutions, and, combining with the aboriginal
culture, develop the new era apparent in the art relics
of this western plateau.
</p>

<p>
A series of struggles soon ensues, out of which rises
in the twelfth or thirteenth century the Quiché
empire. Subordinate tribes gradually acquire sufficient
strength, however, to cast off a yoke which has
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_621' href='#Page_621'>621</a></span>
grown burdensome, and foremost among the new
nations figure the Cakchiquels, who in the early part
of the fifteenth century are dividing domination with
the Quichés. The Cakchiquels themselves divide soon
after, the northern and weaker branch forming the
Zutugils, their respective capitals being Patinamit and
Atitlan. These, with their former masters, are the
three rival monarchies of Guatemala in the beginning
of the sixteenth century. The Quichés, who govern
at Utatlan, nevertheless maintain a certain preëminence,
both in political standing and culture. There
are, besides, a number of minor independent peoples
only too eager to stimulate enmity between the leading
powers, and to ally themselves with that which is
likely to favor their own interests. This condition of
things, so favorable to foreign intrigue, has not escaped
the attention of the ambitious Aztecs, who are already
masters of the Soconusco border province. Their
agents are in fact scattered throughout the country,
laying plans for further conquests, when the Spaniards
step in to lay their iron hand upon the country, which
here as in other parts they find too well prepared for
them by ambition and misrule.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">SIGNS AND OMENS.</div>

<p>
Nor do we fail to find foreshadowed here, as elsewhere
upon the pages of history, the momentous
event. There were startling occurrences, such as conflagrations
and locust ravages; there was a ball of fire,
which for many evenings rose in the east and followed
the path of the sun; and there were other like omens.
When the troubled priests went to seek an explanation
from the oracular black stone at Cahbaha, their awe
was increased by finding it broken in twain. In
1520 cholera swept the Cakchiquel country, followed
in 1521 by the small-pox, which, after desolating
Mexico, fell upon these southern provinces and carried
off half the population, including the two kings and
the flower of the nobility, leaving gaunt famine in its
trail by way of remembrance. Amid such presages
it was that the news came of the achievements of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_622' href='#Page_622'>622</a></span>
white men in Montezuma's realms, of their wonderful
war enginery and invincible prowess. Less awed by
these reports, the Quichés, who had probably suffered
less from epidemics, prepared to resist the prospective
invasion with the same determination that they had
formerly shown against the Aztecs; but the Cakchiquels
were more broken in power and spirit, and more
inclined to welcome the new-comers, particularly since
the Quichés were again becoming dangerous.<a id='FA_XXII-5' href='#FN_XXII-5' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-5]</a>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">KING BELEHE QAT.</div>

<p class="p2">
Thus stood affairs when the two messengers of
Alvarado appeared at Patinamit. On their arrival at
the capital they were peaceably received. When admitted
into the presence of King Belehe Qat<a id='FA_XXII-6' href='#FN_XXII-6' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-6]</a> they
were asked if they had been sent by Malinche,<a id='FA_XXII-7' href='#FN_XXII-7' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-7]</a> and
whether they had come on great sea monsters similar
to those that had been seen off the coast the year
before,<a id='FA_XXII-8' href='#FN_XXII-8' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-8]</a> and whether they were accustomed to tell the
truth; whereupon they made answer that they had
come from the emperor of the world, and from his
invincible captain, who, though no god,<a id='FA_XXII-9' href='#FN_XXII-9' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-9]</a> had found his
way hither to show them the path to paradise. Their
journey had been by land, they said, and they would
by no means lie, their truthfulness being as unvarying
as the polar star. Then one of them<a id='FA_XXII-10' href='#FN_XXII-10' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-10]</a> drew an enormous
carac with six masts, and, Peter Martyr adds,
as many decks, which was indeed a fair specimen of
Spanish veracity. The Indian nobles gazed in wonder
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_623' href='#Page_623'>623</a></span>
at the enormous vessel, with its sails, and spars, and
countless ropes, and thought it must indeed be a true
representation, since there were so many adjuncts.
</p>

<p>
At length the king spoke. "How is it that the
Spaniards are so invincible, being no larger than other
men?" "In the God of heaven our strength lies!"
came the answer; "He whose holy law we proclaim,
he gives us victories, lending us courage sharp like
iron, and intelligence powerful like caged thunder, and
beasts withal, which are in themselves a host." And
the diplomatic Apelles drew a colossal horse, of fierce
aspect, mounted by a man. The spectators were awe-stricken.
Right willingly now would the king enter
into an alliance with these wonderful beings. He
would supply them with fifty thousand warriors if
they would overthrow the neighboring foes who were
devastating his land. Alas! for ready friendship, the
humble offer of vassalage, and open hand; peaceful
policy or bold defiance alike led to the oppressor's
yoke. The embassadors were dismissed, promising to
report the ruler's wishes to their commander, and
gayly they went their way, accompanied by five thousand
slaves, laden with the products and manufactures
of the land, with cacao, maize, and poultry, besides
raiment, and vases, and jewelry to the value of twenty
thousand pesos de oro.<a id='FA_XXII-11' href='#FN_XXII-11' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-11]</a>
</p>

<p>
On receiving this earnest of advantage Alvarado
hastened back to impart the news to his chief and to
assist him in plans for conquest. It was determined
to advance at once by sea and land. A force of forty
Spaniards, mostly carpenters and seamen, was despatched
to Zacatula, on the Pacific coast, to engage
in ship-building, as an aid to proposed conquest and
colonization. We find, moreover, that during this
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_624' href='#Page_624'>624</a></span>
same year, 1522, two Spanish envoys, with certain
natives of Mexico and of the province of Soconusco,
were sent to Utatlan and Guatemala,<a id='FA_XXII-12' href='#FN_XXII-12' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-12]</a> and on their
return they met Cortés at Tuxpan,<a id='FA_XXII-13' href='#FN_XXII-13' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-13]</a> on his way back
from Pánuco, where he had been engaged in pacification.
About one hundred<a id='FA_XXII-14' href='#FN_XXII-14' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-14]</a> embassadors accompanied
these messengers, sent by the rulers of those
cities to tender friendship and service to the king of
Spain. Nothing could be more courteous and dignified
than the bearing of Cortés while accepting this
allegiance, as he terms it, and the costly offerings of
gold ware, rare plumes, and feathered tapestry brought
by the Indian envoys; and again were produced and
presented with imposing mien the gewgaws of Spain.
Especial favor and kind treatment, the embassadors
were assured, should be extended to these princes and
their subjects, inasmuch as this tender of friendship
was voluntary and in good faith. An appropriate display
of warlike power was made before the visitors,
who were then dismissed.<a id='FA_XXII-15' href='#FN_XXII-15' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-15]</a>
</p>

<p>
About the beginning of 1523, however, rumors
reached Cortés that these allies were scarcely to be
relied on, and that the settlers in Soconusco were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_625' href='#Page_625'>625</a></span>
molested by inroads from the southern provinces.<a id='FA_XXII-16' href='#FN_XXII-16' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-16]</a>
Although the truth of the reports was doubtful,
Cortés deemed it not adverse to his interests to regard
them as true, for there were advantages in the
conquest of rich provinces which peaceful possession
could not give.<a id='FA_XXII-17' href='#FN_XXII-17' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-17]</a>.
</p>

<p>
The subjugation of the districts being thus resolved
on, naturally the leadership fell to Alvarado, who had
already taken some steps in that direction, as we have
seen. He had probably stronger claims upon Cortés
than any captain in the Mexican conquest, having
shared with him, as second in command, many desperate
battles and many brilliant triumphs. Perhaps
more so than with any of the others, his character was
apparent on the surface: reckless, impetuous, merciless,
lacking in veracity if not in common honesty, he
was still zealous and courageous; and with his native
dexterity, and past experiences under Grijalva and
Cortés, he may now be called an able commander. If
less staid and regular than Olid, his loyalty was regarded
as above suspicion. At all events, the general
could not himself undertake the work, and the best
proxy was this captain.<a id='FA_XXII-18' href='#FN_XXII-18' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-18]</a>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">PERSONNEL OF THE EXPEDITION.</div>

<p>
Preparations were begun early in 1523. A force
was quickly organized, but operations were diverted
by the inopportune arrival at Pánuco of the adelantado
Francisco de Garay, who endeavored to supplant
Cortés in that quarter. Alvarado was therefore despatched
against the interloper, and it was not until
the 6th of December that the expedition set out for
Guatemala. It was a gallant array, as finally formed,
the very flower of New Spain chivalry, one hundred
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_626' href='#Page_626'>626</a></span>
and twenty horsemen, three hundred infantry, of
whom one hundred and thirty were cross-bowmen
and arquebusiers, and over twenty thousand picked
native warriors.<a id='FA_XXII-19' href='#FN_XXII-19' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-19]</a> Spiritual guides were present in the
persons of two friars and two army chaplains.<a id='FA_XXII-20' href='#FN_XXII-20' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-20]</a> And it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_627' href='#Page_627'>627</a></span>
was a proud moment for Alvarado as he marched out
of the Mexican capital the chief commander of that
brilliant company, the panoplies of the cavalry glittering
high above the flashing helmets of the infantry,
while the long sombre line of swarthy allies
was broken here and there by the colored insignia
and gaudy plumes of some great chieftain. For a
little way Cortés himself rode beside his subordinate
and friend, reiterating his instructions, charging him
specially to render punctually his report, and such a
one as would be acceptable to his majesty. Nor was
the parting devoid of pleasure, for one would be rid
of sometimes unpleasant interference in affairs at the
capital, while the other would be independent of any
superior.<a id='FA_XXII-21' href='#FN_XXII-21' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-21]</a>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">AT TEHUANTEPEC.</div>

<p>
It was about the middle of the dry season; and
the time of year, the weather, and the condition of
the roads all were favorable, so that the southward
march promised to be an easy one. After turning
aside to quell an insurrection in the mountains of
Tehuantepec<a id='FA_XXII-22' href='#FN_XXII-22' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-22]</a> Alvarado continued his course, and on
the 12th of January, 1524, wrote to Cortés from Tehuantepec
city, where he had been received in all
friendship and with reiterated expressions of allegiance.
He then entered the province of Soconusco,
upon whose people the Spanish yoke seemed to rest a
little heavy.
</p>

<p>
The shadows which flit behind substantial record
in Soconusco's history represent the people as independent
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_628' href='#Page_628'>628</a></span>
for ages and in the usual state of chronic
warfare with their neighbors,<a id='FA_XXII-23' href='#FN_XXII-23' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-23]</a> by reason whereof
they became so weakened as to fall under the sway
of the Olmecs, who oppressed them almost beyond
endurance. Numbers indeed abandoned their homes,
leaving many tracts nearly depopulated. Under Aztec
domination, however, they regained somewhat their
strength, and when the Europeans came the district
was quite populous and advanced in civilization. And
now, when the purposes of the Spaniards were made
known to them, they turned and joined the nations
of Guatemala confederated for resistance.
</p>

<p>
At no great distance from the Tehuantepec border
Alvarado first encountered serious opposition, and
before the Guatemalan border was reached many
patriots had been punished and many freemen made
slaves. The subjugation of the Soconuscans was decided
by a pitched battle at Tonalá a town of fifty
thousand inhabitants,<a id='FA_XXII-24' href='#FN_XXII-24' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-24]</a> where a large army under a
Quiché prince was defeated.<a id='FA_XXII-25' href='#FN_XXII-25' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-25]</a> At the border of Guatemala
proper the army entered, early in February, the
dense forests of Zapotitlan,<a id='FA_XXII-26' href='#FN_XXII-26' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-26]</a> now Costa Cuca and Costa
Grande. For three days they marched in the shadow
of lofty evergreens, through uninhabited wilds, skirting
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_629' href='#Page_629'>629</a></span>
pestiferous swamps or plunging into snake-infested
canebrakes; now hacking their way through thickets,
now fording high-banked streams or scaling rugged
hill-sides, while painted macaws screamed at them,
and poisonous insects left their sting. Amidst the
customary prayings and cursings they struggled forward,
and finally emerged from the forest and entered
cultivated lands.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">APPROACH TO ZAPOTITLAN.</div>

<p>
Messengers had been sent forward summoning the
provinces in due form to allegiance. And now were
captured three natives, believed to be spies from the
city of Zapotitlan,<a id='FA_XXII-27' href='#FN_XXII-27' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-27]</a> who were despatched with a
second requirement, to which there was no response.
The Spaniards then advanced along a broad open
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_630' href='#Page_630'>630</a></span>
highway, and soon after entered a narrower road,
which they found barricaded; whereupon they pitched
camp in an open plain near by. On a height beyond
a deep ravine, through which flowed a river,<a id='FA_XXII-28' href='#FN_XXII-28' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-28]</a> stood
the city, bathed in the bright rays of the setting sun,
like a beautiful maiden arrayed for the sacrifice. Between
the plain and the city the ground was thickly
covered with plantations of cacao, which would materially
impede the action of cavalry.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">RESULT OF BATTLE.</div>

<p>
The Spaniards had not long to wait attack. In
the dusk of evening a small band sprang from cover
and slew a number of the allies. The cavalry were
thereupon ordered to sweep the plain. They came
upon a large force, and a skirmish ensued in which
some of the horses were injured. Alvarado's blood
was now up, and he ordered an immediate march on
the city. No serious opposition was encountered until
the army came to the ravine, spanned by a narrow,
rudely built wooden bridge, the crossing of which was
fiercely contested by a large body of warriors. The
artillery was accordingly brought into action and did
efficient service. The doomed natives fought well,
rallying again and again under the frightful havoc of
the guns, until a great breastwork was formed of their
slain. At length the cavalry, under cover of a heavy
fire, succeeded in forcing a way across the stream and
began to climb the height to a bench overlooking the
ravine. The infantry followed. The passage was
made in the midst of the fiercest attacks; but Alvarado
protected his rear with consummate skill, and
soon he had the satisfaction of drawing up his troops
on the open ground above, safe from molestation. In
the streets of the city, which the army now entered,
the natives made another desperate effort to save
themselves; but without avail. Those terrible guns!
those terrible horses! that life-compelling steel, falling
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_631' href='#Page_631'>631</a></span>
with a force and precision worthy the death-dealing
enginery of the gods! For half a league beyond the
town the allies were permitted to pursue and slay,
after which the victors took up their quarters in the
abandoned market-place, where for two days they
rested and reconnoitred.<a id='FA_XXII-29' href='#FN_XXII-29' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-29]</a>

<div class="sidenote">DEATH OF KICAB TANTUB.</div>

<p>
As we may well imagine, the presence of the conquering
army created a profound sensation throughout
the whole Quiché dominion. They were a warlike
people, rulers and subjects, and proud withal. It is
stated that while Alvarado was yet in Soconusco,
Kicab Tanub, king of Utatlan, had endeavored to
bring the lord of the Zutugils and the lord of the
Cakchiquels into a combination which he was forming
for purposes of defence against the approaching army.
But they haughtily declined the overtures; one because
the Quiché king had secretly aided a rebellious
vassal of his, and the other because he felt
sufficiently powerful to defend his gates against all
comers. The ruler of the Cakchiquels,<a id='FA_XXIII-1' href='#FN_XXIII-1' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-1]</a> indeed, declared
openly for the Spaniards, while the king of the
Zutugils was so insulting in his rejection of the proposed
confederation that King Kicab Tanub was
deeply humiliated. His chagrin, added to the anxieties
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_633' href='#Page_633'>633</a></span>
attending preparations for defence, brought on
a fever, from which he died in a few days. He was
succeeded by his son, Tecum Umam.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile all the forces of the kingdom were placed
under arms, and a general muster of allies and tributaries
was appointed to be held at Totonicapan.
Thither marched Tecum Umam at the head of sixty
thousand warriors, and he was soon joined by a still
larger force. With this army he occupied the table-land
on which stood the strong city of Xelahuh,<a id='FA_XXIII-2' href='#FN_XXIII-2' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-2]</a> and
which overlooked the ravines of the Tziha and the
Olintepec. Ten lords governed this city, and with all
their armies brilliantly equipped they went to the
assistance of the Quiché monarch. Never since the
days of the great Kicab<a id='FA_XXIII-3' href='#FN_XXIII-3' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-3]</a> had there been seen on the
Central American plateau a military display so imposing.
Redoubtable warriors were there, made fierce
of aspect by the skins of wild beasts, the lion, the
jaguar, and the bear, and a vast array of fighting
men, two hundred thousand and more,<a id='FA_XXIII-4' href='#FN_XXIII-4' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-4]</a> while conspicuous
above them all in military splendor was the
Quiché king and the royal retinue. On one side of
the elevated plain was Zacaha, a line of fortifications
commanding the defile through the mountains by
which the invading army had to enter. The place
was now strengthened by throwing up round many
of the hills stone walls, along the sides of which a
ditch was carried, set with poisonous stakes. A number
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_634' href='#Page_634'>634</a></span>
of military machines were constructed, such as
towers on wheels, and catapults for hurling missiles,
which would have done honor to the man-killing profession
of any European nation of that day. There
King Tecum Umam intrenched himself and awaited
the incoming army.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">PALAHUNOH PASS.</div>

<p class="p2">
And to this inland plateau, in the very heart of
the Quiché country, Alvarado was now with difficulty
making his way through a narrow gorge of the sierra,
leaving the people of Zapotitlan quite subdued. After
crossing two rapid rivers a steep ascent six leagues
in length was begun, leading to Palahunoh, as the
pass was called. It was indeed a rugged way, more
in the nature of a height to be scaled than an opening
in a chain of mountains. So severe were the
struggles with nature and Satan, to whom these stubborn
soldiers ascribed most ills, that their former
troubles seemed to them as pastime now. The place
was so steep and rough that it was with the utmost
difficulty the horses, plunging and struggling, could
make their way up. It was impossible to accomplish
the whole distance in one day, and the panting and
foot-sore army, too exhausted to proceed farther,<a id='FA_XXIII-5' href='#FN_XXIII-5' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-5]</a> was
ordered to encamp when half the ascent had been
made. The next day through similar efforts they
reached the summit, where a woman and a dog were
found sacrificed, in token of defiance and challenge to
war, as the interpreters explained.
</p>

<p>
During the descent to the plain, at no great distance,
in a narrow part of the pass, a strong breastwork
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_635' href='#Page_635'>635</a></span>
of undefended palisades was discovered, quite
incomprehensible to the Spaniards, as a few men
properly disposed could have held the place against
any invading army.
</p>

<p>
The nature of the ground was still so unfavorable
for cavalry that Alvarado sent forward the infantry,
and presently the enemy was encountered. A body
of three or four thousand fell upon the allies and
threw them into confusion. The cross-bowmen, however,
came to their support, and soon the entire infantry
were engaged in the contest, which was carried
on along the hill-tops and down the slopes until the
ravine of Olintepec River was reached. There the
Spaniards were drawn into an ambuscade, formed by
over six thousand warriors from Utatlan, from whom
they received some wounds.<a id='FA_XXIII-6' href='#FN_XXIII-6' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-6]</a> The troops were soon
collected on the other side of the ravine, however;
but none too soon, for presently was seen advancing
with bold front a detachment of the grand army,
thirty thousand strong, as if to annihilate them at
one blow. Fortunately the ground here was level
and favorable for the cavalry. The horses being
greatly fatigued, Alvarado determined to wait till
the last moment before charging. After permitting
the enemy to amuse themselves with the allies during
a brief breathing space, their confidence momentarily
increasing, the commander at length gave the order
to the impatient horsemen, who swept forward instantly
like an avalanche, and as if the hills indeed
had fallen on them the affrighted Quichés scattered.
Mad Ajax among the defenceless sheep took not
more lives than did each Spaniard on that day. Like
sheep the poor natives scattered, and like sheep they
were pursued and slaughtered.<a id='FA_XXIII-7' href='#FN_XXIII-7' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-7]</a>
</p>

<p>
A league farther brought the thirsty troops to some
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_636' href='#Page_636'>636</a></span>
springs, but the period of refreshment was short. At
hand was a yet more formidable native force, led by
Prince Ahzumanche, one of the highest among the
relatives and officers of the king.
</p>

<p>
The engagement which followed was exceptionably
bloody. The Quichés approached over the extensive
plains, and when they had arrived at a position favorable
for the Spaniards to make the attack the horsemen
charged upon them. But the Quichés were
better on their guard than before. Recovered from
their panic, and animated by the example of their
leader, they displayed greater bravery this time,
standing the shock unflinchingly,<a id='FA_XXIII-8' href='#FN_XXIII-8' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-8]</a> fighting foot to
foot, or banded two and three together, endeavoring
by their own strength to overthrow the horses, seizing
them by mane and tail, and trying to pull them down,
and laying hold of the riders to unhorse them. The
Spaniards were indeed closely beset, and for a time
it seemed by no means certain that victory would
finally declare for them. But what naked power could
long withstand the steady fire of arquebuse and cross-bow,
the steady fall of sword-blow and lance-thrust!
</p>

<p>
Relaxing their efforts for a moment, the natives
were charged by the cavalry with deadly result, and
were trampled under foot by hundreds, and speedily
routed. For a league they were followed with great
havoc, till they took refuge in a stronghold of the
sierra. By pretending flight, however, Alvarado drew
them from their position to the open plain, and then
wheeled and fell upon them. The carnage for a time
was dreadful; the ground was covered with the mangled
bodies of the dead and dying, and the waters of the
Olintepec ran crimson with blood. And henceforth

<p>
Among the fallen was Prince Ahzumanche, and a
number of the nobility and chiefs. The contest being
over, the army encamped for the night at the springs
before mentioned. The loss to the Spaniards, as
usual, was insignificant.<a id='FA_XXIII-10' href='#FN_XXIII-10' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-10]</a>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">A MAGNIFICENT PRIZE.</div>

<p class="p2">
Let us pause for a moment to review the position
of the invaders. They had surmounted with irresistible
progress the coast range, had crossed the summit,
fought their way down the corresponding slopes, and
were within a league of Xelahuh, the great stronghold
of the Quichés, on their western confines. All the
defences to it had been won, the Zacaha fortifications
had been carried, passive nature's majestic guardianship
had been overcome, and human opposition had
proved futile. Far behind them stood the deadly
forest through which they had struggled; over the
golden-edged hills, the rugged steep by which they
had made their way hither. Around them now were
open pine woods,<a id='FA_XXIII-11' href='#FN_XXIII-11' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-11]</a> and at their feet the wide cultivated
plains of the table-lands on which the sun shed
its uninterrupted rays. Dotted with towns and parti-colored
with maize-fields and orchards, silver-threaded
by streams, the landscape displayed before the Spaniards
the picture of a paradise. And this beautiful
realm now lay helpless in the conqueror's grasp, its
very air<a id='FA_XXIII-12' href='#FN_XXIII-12' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-12]</a> becoming traitorous by refreshing and invigorating
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_638' href='#Page_638'>638</a></span>
the invaders, bracing their nerves and inspiring
their hearts to new enterprise.
</p>

<p class="p2">
At dawn the Spanish camp was astir; and while
the voices of Christian priests chanting praises to God
for past victories floated over the hideous battle-field,
Christian soldiers were buckling on their armor for
the further butchering of helpless human beings who
had done them no harm. A hermitage and a town
were established at Zacaha, the former under the
charge of Friar Francisco Martinez de Pontaza,<a id='FA_XXIII-13' href='#FN_XXIII-13' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-13]</a>
whose memory was ever after fragrant in those parts,
the latter under the direction of Juan de Leon Cardona.<a id='FA_XXIII-14' href='#FN_XXIII-14' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-14]</a>
The natives of the subjugated neighborhood
finally came in and helped to swell the numbers of the
town, which was called Quezaltenango.<a id='FA_XXIII-15' href='#FN_XXIII-15' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-15]</a>
</p>

<p>
These measures taken,<a id='FA_XXIII-16' href='#FN_XXIII-16' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-16]</a> the army advanced on
Xelahuh,<a id='FA_XXIII-17' href='#FN_XXIII-17' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-17]</a> only to find it abandoned. The inhabitants,
terror-stricken at the success of the invaders,
had fled to the mountains. Alvarado took up his
quarters in the deserted city, where for six days he
remained, resting and reconnoitring.<a id='FA_XXIII-18' href='#FN_XXIII-18' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-18]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_639' href='#Page_639'>639</a></span>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE GRAND ARMY.</div>

<p>
Tecum Umam was an ambitious prince and a brave
commander. With no small concern he had seen defeated
one after another the forces sent against the
foe, and he now resolved to take the field in person.
About noon on the seventh day of their sojourn at
Xelahuh the Spaniards saw converging to that point
from every quarter dense masses of warriors.<a id='FA_XXIII-19' href='#FN_XXIII-19' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-19]</a> Well
aware that his great strength lay in the cavalry,
Alvarado with a large part of his force<a id='FA_XXIII-20' href='#FN_XXIII-20' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-20]</a> hastened to
occupy an open plain, three leagues in length, at no
great distance from the city. Tecum Umam was
shrewd enough to comprehend the manœuvre, and
before the last Spaniard was a bow-shot from camp
the Quiché army in two principal divisions was upon
them. Alvarado had divided his cavalry into two
bodies, commanded respectively by Pedro Puertocarrero
and Hernando de Chaves, who were directed
to assail at different points one of the opposing bodies
when well in position, while the infantry, commanded
by himself, were to engage with the other. The onset
was terrible. Through and through the dense columns
rush the horsemen, heedless alike of the flint-tipped
arrow, the javelin with fire-hardened point, and the
slung pebble. Resistance was not possible. Plunged
through and hurled to earth, crushed beneath the horses'
hoofs, the broken ranks of this division sought the
protection of the other. Thus half of Tecum's last
hope was lost, while the other half was fast dwindling.
Early in the combat the Quiché king had recognized
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_640' href='#Page_640'>640</a></span>
the conspicuous figure of the mounted Spanish commander,
and as Tecum now saw his forces broken by
the cavalry, he determined upon one last desperate
effort. Gathering around him a few chosen warriors,
he threw himself in person upon Alvarado, and with
his own hand so wounded his horse that the Spaniard
was obliged to fall back and mount another. A second
and a third time the undaunted warrior assailed his
superior foe, till pierced by Alvarado's lance he fell,
staining with his life-blood the ground he had fought
so bravely to defend.
</p>

<p>
It was not often that the heavenly powers deigned
to help the poor natives in their dire struggle with
the steel-clad Europeans, as was so frequently the case
with the Spaniards. The gods usually prefer fighting
on the strongest side; but here we find an exception.
It is my duty to relate, as a truthful historian, that
during the mortal combat between these two leaders
an eagle with great pinions was observed by the
Quiché army circling round and round the Spanish
commander, ever and anon swooping down upon him,
and with beak and claw attacking him about the
head. It was the <i>nagual</i>, the guardian spirit of Tecum
Umam. But less strong than Alvarado's lance, it was
discomfited at the moment of the monarch's death,
and disappeared from the sight of the vanquished
Quichés.<a id='FA_XXIII-21' href='#FN_XXIII-21' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-21]</a>
</p>

<p>
Contrary to the usual course pursued by natives in
warfare, the fall of their commander did not immediately
disperse the Quiché warriors, but seemed rather
to enrage them; for the moment after there fell upon
the Spaniards such a blinding tempest of javelins as
would have delighted the Spartan Dieneces. It was
but for a moment, however; it was their last expiring
effort, for soon the cavalry came thundering on their
flanks, dispersing and slaying after the usual fashion.
For two leagues along the plain they were pursued by
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_641' href='#Page_641'>641</a></span>
the horsemen, who then turned and rode back, repeating
the carnage over the same field. The slaughter
was particularly bloody at a stream on one side of the
plain, and the commander proudly refers to it in his
despatch.<a id='FA_XXIII-22' href='#FN_XXIII-22' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-22]</a> The infantry captured a vast multitude
which had taken refuge from the insatiate horsemen
on a hill near by.
</p>

<p>
Thus ended another day in the annals of the grand
extermination, a day dark indeed for the noble Quiché
nation, but of which European progress and propagandizing
might well be proud.<a id='FA_XXIII-23' href='#FN_XXIII-23' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-23]</a>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">PERSUASIVE PROSELYTING.</div>

<p>
By this crushing defeat the Quichés were humbled
and their confidence in their deities, not to say
themselves, was weakened. Though in great grief
at the loss of their chief and the triumph of the
Spaniards, an opportunity was given them through
the preaching of the priests Torres and Pontaza to
embrace the religion of their conquerors. Four captive
chieftains<a id='FA_XXIII-24' href='#FN_XXIII-24' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-24]</a> of Xelahuh were baptized and received
their liberty. Christian raiment with swords was
then given them and they were entertained at the
table of Alvarado.<a id='FA_XXIII-25' href='#FN_XXIII-25' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-25]</a> After this they were sent out
as missionaries to their affrighted brethren, bringing
quite a number to a knowledge of the Savior. They
also aided in erecting a more suitable hermitage at
Zacaha, and in building houses for the Donatís.<a id='FA_XXIII-26' href='#FN_XXIII-26' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-26]</a> Nay
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_642' href='#Page_642'>642</a></span>
more; in their growing enthusiasm they suggested
that the place where Tonatiuh had gained his
crowning victory, and over which still hung the
odor of corruption and blood, the blood of their
slain countrymen, should be called by the name of
Espíritu Santo.

</p>

<p>
Upon the central plateau, near the present town of
Santa Cruz del Quiché, stood Utatlan,<a id='FA_XXIV-1' href='#FN_XXIV-1' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-1]</a> the ancient
capital of the Quiché nation. It was surrounded by
a deep ravine, and could be entered only at two points.
To one of these entrances over thirty stone steps
led up an almost perpendicular cliff; to the other
a narrow artificial causeway, connected at one point
by a bridge which could be easily destroyed. The
city was further strengthened by the grim fortress
of Atalaya, four stories in height, and the pyramidal
fortification of El Resguardo,<a id='FA_XXIV-2' href='#FN_XXIV-2' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-2]</a> one hundred and
twenty feet high. In wealth and splendor Utatlan,
in which twenty generations of the present dynasty
had reigned, vied with the city of the Aztec kings
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_644' href='#Page_644'>644</a></span>
and the gardened capital of the Incas. In its centre
stood the royal palace, surrounded by the imposing
residences of the nobles, and beyond, the humbler
dwellings of the common people. The palace was
one of the most magnificent structures of Central
America. It was built of hewn stone of various
colors, mosaic in appearance, and its colossal dimensions,
and elegant and stately architectural form, excited
mingled awe and admiration.<a id='FA_XXIV-3' href='#FN_XXIV-3' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-3]</a>
</p>

<p>
Within the lofty portals the quarters of the household
guards, surrounding a spacious barrack yard, were
first presented to view. Dusky warriors, lancers, and
archers, clad in wildly picturesque garbs of dappled
tiger-skins or sombre bear-hides, in brilliant plumes
and polished arms, with silent tread measured the
well paved court. In the principal apartments near
at hand the various arms and paraphernalia of battle
lay ready for immediate use, while on the walls hung
hard-won trophies of war. Next lay the residence
of the unmarried princes, and beyond this the palace
proper, containing besides the apartments of the monarch
the council-chamber, with the gorgeous throne
canopied with costly tapestry of feather work of rare
designs and wrought with cunning skill; also the royal
treasury, the hall of justice, and the armory. Three
separate suites of rooms, for morning, afternoon, and
night, were each day occupied by the monarch, and
all these more private apartments looked out upon
delightful gardens, with trees, and flowers, and fruits,
and in their midst menageries and aviaries, with rare
and curious collections. Beyond lay the separate
palaces of the monarch's queens and concubines, with
their baths, and gardens, and miniature lakes; and
lastly the maidens' college, in which were reared and
educated the female offspring of royal blood.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_645' href='#Page_645'>645</a></span>
</p>

<p>
And all this was but one pile of buildings, the
largest, it is true; but there were others of no mean
pretensions, the residences of the nobles and of the
wealthy trading class. Of a truth Utatlan was a fine
city, and a strong and noble one. And must it now
be yielded to the spoiler? Is there no hope? None.
Then perish all, for who would live with king and
country gone; and with its occupants, also this fair
capital which so long has harbored kings. Ah! if this
strong trap could but be baited, and the white foxes
enticed thereto and strangled. Rare thought! It
were worth dying a dozen times to see these braggarts
but once die. And so the Quiché cunning ones
determined. In general council it was agreed that
the Spaniards should be invited to a feast, and while
there the city should be burned and brought down
upon their heads!
</p>

<div class="sidenote">OXIB QUIEH SUCCEEDS TECUM UMAM.</div>

<p>
By the death of Tecum Umam his son Oxib
Quieh<a id='FA_XXIV-4' href='#FN_XXIV-4' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-4]</a> succeeded to the throne. His situation was
not an enviable one. The best troops, in fact the very
flower of the nation, had been destroyed or scattered.
His father, with numbers of the first men
of the land, had fallen, without having in a single instance
gained a battle or baffled the foe. Their puny
efforts were as gnats stinging or destroying a band of
wild boars.
</p>

<p>
Yet the grandson of the great Kicab Tanub
would not abandon the field without a struggle. The
council might burn the city if they chose. And
though their hopes and the prospects of success were
great, the king and his nobles relaxed none the less
their efforts to raise fresh troops. Should the plan
fail, they would again take the field. Not only did
Oxib Quieh draw all the forces possible from his own
provinces, but he adopted every means to smooth
the differences that existed between himself and the
neighboring provinces. By these exertions at length
a strong league was formed, and again the natives in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_646' href='#Page_646'>646</a></span>
formidable numbers were ready to do battle for their
gods and their country at the proper moment.
</p>

<p>
These preparations completed, an embassy with
presents of gold was despatched to greet the conqueror,
to sue for peace, and to tender their king's
submission as vassal to the king of Spain. Alvarado
was also invited to the court of Utatlan, where the
king was waiting to offer in person his allegiance and
entertain with all due honor the redoubtable Spaniard.
Alvarado graciously accepted both the presents and
the invitation, and made presents in return, and on
the following day set out with his army to pay the
promised visit. It was quite natural on both sides,
the invitation and the acceptance. Here were war
and a conquered country; here the conquered with
overtures of peace; and so the Spaniards marched
into the trap without suspicion.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PLOT DISCOVERED.</div>

<p>
But as they passed along the narrow causeway and
came to the bridge, certain soldiers<a id='FA_XXIV-5' href='#FN_XXIV-5' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-5]</a> fancied they saw
where it had been recently weakened. When the
attention of Alvarado was called to it he made no
alarm, nor did he turn a moment from his course.
He relished the flavor of such an adventure, and
grasping his sword the tighter he commanded the
strictest caution and the closest observation. On
entering the city the suspicions of the Spaniards were
confirmed. The men were armed; the women and
children had been withdrawn; there were few provisions
at hand and little valuable merchandise in the
storehouses; in many buildings throughout the city
brush and firewood had been deposited, while the
anxiety displayed in the uneasy deportment of the
natives themselves could not be disguised. It was
observed, too, that the streets were so narrow and
the houses so compact that it would be impossible
for the cavalry to move; and lastly, the Quezaltenango
allies who accompanied the Spaniards obtained
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_647' href='#Page_647'>647</a></span>
and brought to Alvarado positive information of the
intentions of the Quiché chiefs.<a id='FA_XXIV-6' href='#FN_XXIV-6' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-6]</a>
</p>

<p>
Not only are prompt measures now necessary, but
they must be such as will not arouse the suspicions of
a most suspicious foe, whose keen eyes are watching
every movement. Without formally summoning a
council Alvarado moves in holiday mien among his
officers, dropping here a hint and laying there a
stern command; meanwhile, outwardly undisturbed,
he rides forward into the nest of nobles awaiting him
and greets them with a frank smile amid renewed
protestations of friendship. This done he looks about
for the disposal of the horses. They are worshipful
brutes, in some respects the equals and even the
superiors of men; they are not given to feasting like
men, but they must not be forgotten at the feast.
Their greatest delight will be to feed upon the open
plain; he will conduct them there and return without
delay. Greatly disconcerted the nobles press the
Tonatiuh to immediate entertainment, which even
now awaits him; under the direction of the soldiers
they will provide the best care for the noble animals.
By no means, Alvarado intimates; the horses will
never forgive him if he neglects them on so important
an occasion. Thus all the Spaniards return over
the causeway, and the weakened bridge, and with a
feeling of intense relief reach the plain in safety.
</p>

<p>
Now for a sweet morsel of revenge. While gathering
grass for the horses the soldiers are fired on from
the ravines and thickets, and one Spaniard, a servant
of the commander, is killed. The king and his nobles,
who remain near the city entrance, on witnessing the
outrage from this distance are distressed, and take
measures to prevent hostile demonstrations on the part
of their people. Alvarado pretends to regard it all as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_648' href='#Page_648'>648</a></span>
of no moment, and continues his attitude of confidence
and cordiality with the chiefs. It is unfortunate, this
accident of the servant; but after what has happened
probably the feast had better be postponed. As a
further mark of friendship and esteem, will Oxib
Quieh and his companions look in upon the camp of
the Spaniards? Poor boy! So easily caught, and in
a trap, a steel one, quite different from the bungling
bridge-drop at Utatlan. Now may all men open their
eyes and judge as gods, for these present must die!
</p>

<p>
The mask is thrown aside, and the avenger in his
wrath stands revealed. Oxib Quieh and his caciques
are seized and charged with their treacherous intentions.
Their condemnation is a matter predetermined,
but execution is delayed a little that the tiger may
sport with his prey. Little gold has been gathered
on this expedition, and it may be well to put upon the
scene in Guatemala the grand drama of Montezuma
not long since performed at the Mexican capital. The
prisoners shall have their lives if they gather much
gold. This done, they shall have their lives if they
gather more gold. And when the kingdom is stripped
of its gold and the Spaniards become impatient, a great
fire is built, into which those of the prisoners who are
not hanged are thrown alive; and the smoke ascends
to heaven as grateful incense to their god.<a id='FA_XXIV-7' href='#FN_XXIV-7' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-7]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_649' href='#Page_649'>649</a></span>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">COURAGE OF THE QUICHÉS.</div>

<p>
Notwithstanding these merciless lessons, during
which three of the Quiché kings, of three several
generations in direct line of succession, had been
sacrificed, hostilities were speedily renewed. A fierce
attack was made on all sides, the natives issuing in
great numbers from the many ravines which intersected
the neighboring ground, and the assault
was obstinately maintained for some time; but the artillery<a id='FA_XXIV-8' href='#FN_XXIV-8' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-8]</a>
committed such dreadful destruction, opening
through their dense masses lanes strewn with mutilated
bodies and torn-off limbs, that they speedily
recognized the futility of their attempts, and fled
back to the gulches. Keeping ever to inaccessible
ground, and avoiding open engagement,<a id='FA_XXIV-9' href='#FN_XXIV-9' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-9]</a> they harassed
the army incessantly, by cutting off stragglers and inflicting
harm in any way that they were able. At
length Alvarado determined upon the plan of burning
their city and devastating the country; and he sent to
the friendly king of the Cakchiquels, requesting a
contingent of troops to assist him in dislodging the
Quichés from their fastnesses. Four thousand warriors
were at once sent<a id='FA_XXIV-10' href='#FN_XXIV-10' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-10]</a> by the submissive lord, with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_650' href='#Page_650'>650</a></span>
which additional force, and the energetic measures he
pursued, Alvarado carried on the process of subjection
with effect. The warlike Quichés, their city
burned,<a id='FA_XXIV-11' href='#FN_XXIV-11' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-11]</a> their crops destroyed, hunted from one retreat
to another, driven from their lands, at length were
forced to yield. Alvarado received their overtures
with generosity. He pardoned the repentant in his
great mercy, and promised them their lives, at the
same time ordering them to return and occupy their
lands. He moreover released two captive sons of the
royal line and put them in possession of their father's
realm, the leading monarch being named Sequechul.<a id='FA_XXIV-12' href='#FN_XXIV-12' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-12]</a>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">ENSLAVEMENT.</div>

<p>
Thus was terminated for a time the struggle of the
Quichés for independence—a struggle that ceased only
with the destruction of their principal nobility and all
the bravest warriors of the nation. To their obstinate
valor the conqueror himself bears testimony,<a id='FA_XXIV-13' href='#FN_XXIV-13' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-13]</a> and
recognizing the difficulties of his position, and how
man of himself can do so little, he begs Cortés to order
in the Mexican capital a procession of all the clergy,
so that the virgin might help him. And further,
would he "please take care to inform his Majesty how
we are serving him with our persons and means, and
at our own cost, in order that his Majesty may reward
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_651' href='#Page_651'>651</a></span>
us?" Nor did the lieutenant fail to report that his
majesty's interests had been carefully attended to, all
captives taken in the war having been branded and
reduced to slavery.<a id='FA_XXIV-14' href='#FN_XXIV-14' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-14]</a> The royal fifth of these captive
Quichés had been delivered to the treasurer, Baltasar
de Mendoza, who sold them at auction for the better
security of the revenue.

<div class="sidenote">SINACAM GREETS THE SPANIARDS.</div>

<p>
The lieutenant-general was now ready to advance,
and on the 11th of April, 1524, he left Utatlan for
Patinamit, the capital of the Cakchiquels.<a id='FA_XXV-1' href='#FN_XXV-1' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-1]</a> The weak
and yielding Sinacam,<a id='FA_XXV-2' href='#FN_XXV-2' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-2]</a> king of the Cakchiquels, had
already sent with his troops a present of gold to
Alvarado, and renewed his assurances of allegiance.
He now prepared to meet him with such stately pomp
as would be sure to gratify his future master. By this
means he hoped his tottering throne might be secured
to him. Servility and profuse hospitality would surely
win their hearts, he thought; and then, with the powerful
strangers on his side, he might laugh at his enemies.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_653' href='#Page_653'>653</a></span>
As the Spanish army approached his capital he issued
forth with native pageantry to meet it. He was
borne aloft by his nobles on a litter, beneath a canopy
which dazzled the eye with blazing ornaments of gold
and changing hues of quetzal feathers, and round
him were the members of the royal family in litters
scarcely less conspicuous than his own, while a large
body of warriors, with their plumed head-dresses and
warlike apparel, marched in the rear and on either
side. Alvarado's greeting was not of that unalloyed
cordiality which Sinacam had hoped. The Spaniard
was suspicious. He had but just escaped destruction,
and the late danger had taught him discretion. What
he had observed on the march had not tended to inspire
confidence or promote peace of mind. All along
the route despoiled corpses of slain Indians had met
his sight, and the ground was discolored with human
blood. Large bands of armed warriors were everywhere
seen, and it was evident that the whole country
was in arms. But fear was no part of Alvarado's
character; therefore, when the king came near, he
calmly dismounted, approached him with courteous
mien, and with expressions of esteem placed in his
hands a rare and curious piece of silver jewelry; then
he asked with sombre brow, "Why dost thou seek
to do me harm, when I come to do thee good?"
Informed of the meaning of the words so seriously
addressed to him, and conscious of his own faithful
intentions, Sinacam, with calm yet somewhat severe
dignity thanked him first for the present, replying,
"Quiet thy heart, great captain, scion of the sun,
and trust in my love." It was then explained to
Alvarado that the warlike demonstrations he had
discovered were directed against a rebellious vassal,
who, with the aid of the kings of the Quichés and
the Zutugils, had revolted and attempted to make
himself a ruler.<a id='FA_XXV-3' href='#FN_XXV-3' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-3]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_654' href='#Page_654'>654</a></span>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">PATINAMIT.</div>

<p>
Alvarado professed to be satisfied, and permitted
himself to be escorted by the monarch to the capital.<a id='FA_XXV-4' href='#FN_XXV-4' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-4]</a>
Patinamit,<a id='FA_XXV-5' href='#FN_XXV-5' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-5]</a> like Utatlan, was situated in a naturally
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_655' href='#Page_655'>655</a></span>
impregnable position. It occupied an elevated plain,
surrounded by ravines, the side of which nearest
the city was perpendicular to a depth of five or six
hundred feet. Across this chasm, at one point only,
could entrance into the capital be gained, by means
of a narrow causeway, which was closed by two gateways
of stone,<a id='FA_XXV-6' href='#FN_XXV-6' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-6]</a> one on each side of the city wall.
This isolated plateau was about three miles long and
two broad. The chronicler Fuentes describes the
remains of this city with much minuteness, leaving
vivid impressions of its former grandeur. On one
edge of the natural platform, according to that writer,
were the ruins of a magnificent building one hundred
paces square, of extremely well hewn stone.
In front of this edifice extended a plaza, on one side
of which were the remains of a splendid palace, and
in close proximity the foundations of many residences.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_656' href='#Page_656'>656</a></span>
The city was divided by a ditch running north and
south, more than eight feet deep, and surmounted by
concrete breastworks three feet high. This was the
dividing line between the dwellings of the nobles and
those of the commoners. The streets were straight
and wide, and extended in the direction of the four
cardinal points. To the west was a mound dominating
the city, on the summit of which stood a round building
five to six feet high, resembling the breastwork of
a well. Around this the judges held courts; but
before their sentences could be executed they had to
be confirmed by the sacred oracular stone, which was
preserved in a shrine in a deep gulch. It is described
as of a black diaphanous material, more precious than
the ordinary building material. In its gloomy transparency
the demon made visible the judgments that
were to be passed. If no manifestation occurred, the
accused was released; otherwise the sentence was
carried into effect on the same mound where the judges
sat in deliberation. This oracle was consulted also
in matters of war.<a id='FA_XXV-7' href='#FN_XXV-7' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-7]</a>

</p>

<div class="sidenote">ATITLAN.</div>

<p>
King Sinacam's reception of the guests in this his
capital and court fully equalled his promises. Sumptuously
lodged, and bountifully supplied with all the
luxuries the land could produce, Alvarado himself
admits that they could not have met kinder treatment
in their own land.<a id='FA_XXV-8' href='#FN_XXV-8' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-8]</a> For eight days the Spaniards
feasted,<a id='FA_XXV-9' href='#FN_XXV-9' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-9]</a> and in return Sinacam succeeded in
obtaining the aid of his powerful friends against his
hostile neighbors. Frequent conversations were held
relative to the subjugation of the Zutugils, and to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_657' href='#Page_657'>657</a></span>
insure this happy consummation Sinacam expatiated
on the contemptuous pride of Tepepul, king of Atitlan,<a id='FA_XXV-10' href='#FN_XXV-10' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-10]</a>
and his further wickedness in not tendering
allegiance to the Teules.<a id='FA_XXV-11' href='#FN_XXV-11' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-11]</a> It seems that the Zutugil
ruler had incurred the hatred of Sinacam by giving
assistance to his rebellious vassal, Acpocaquil,<a id='FA_XXV-12' href='#FN_XXV-12' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-12]</a> and
making nocturnal incursions into the Cakchiquel territory
by means of canoes. These outrages were
prompted partly by his reliance on the impregnable
position of his city, situated on the hanging cliffs
above Lake Atitlan, seven leagues from Patinamit.
Alvarado required little persuasion to engage in his
favorite pastime of gold-hunting and blood-letting.
He was well aware of the supercilious nature of
Tepepul, and had already determined to visit him in
person. While at Utatlan he had sent four messengers
to the court of Atitlan, bearing the usual
requirement; but the haughty monarch, instead of
paying the respect due to so important a demand, put
the messengers to death. This ruffled Alvarado,
though it did not dishearten him. "I think," he
writes to Cortés respecting this city, "that with the
help of our Lord we shall soon bring it to the service
of his Majesty."<a id='FA_XXV-13' href='#FN_XXV-13' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-13]</a>
</p>

<p>
Alvarado would help King Sinacam, but first he
would like some money for travelling expenses. This
reasonable request could not be refused; not only was
the treasure house of Patinamit emptied, but the
entire district, so far as possible, was stripped of its
gold, jewels, and whatever the Spaniards regarded as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_658' href='#Page_658'>658</a></span>
desirable.<a id='FA_XXV-14' href='#FN_XXV-14' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-14]</a> After this the Spaniards were ready to
pass into the next district and levy like tribute, with
or without bloodshed.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CITY TAKEN.</div>

<p>
In order to proceed with regularity, Alvarado
again sent envoys to Atitlan, demanding that Tepepul
should cease hostilities against the Cakchiquels, who
were the allies of the Teules, and again the ruler displayed
his contempt by putting to death the messengers.<a id='FA_XXV-15' href='#FN_XXV-15' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-15]</a>
Thereupon Alvarado set out with sixty cavalry,
one hundred and fifty infantry, and a large body of
Cakchiquels, commanded by their chiefs.<a id='FA_XXV-16' href='#FN_XXV-16' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-16]</a> Meeting
no opposition he advanced with thirty horse to the
height above the lake, and descended over difficult
ground to a level plain that lay in front of a fortified
rock in the water. This was approachable only by
means of a narrow causeway, intersected at different
points by wooden bridges. Near by the enemy were
now discovered drawn up in two bodies, each eight
thousand strong. They advanced at once to the attack,
armed with lances, bows and arrows, and other
weapons, protected, moreover, by cotton corselets.<a id='FA_XXV-17' href='#FN_XXV-17' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-17]</a>
As the rest of his forces were not far behind, Alvarado
did not hesitate to charge, and when the infantry
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_659' href='#Page_659'>659</a></span>
soon came up the engagement became general.
For some time it was most obstinately maintained,
and numbers of the Spanish soldiers were wounded.
The cavalry, however, succeeded as ever in breaking
the enemy's lines, relieving the hard-pressed foot-soldiers,
who thereupon rallied and renewed their
efforts so vigorously as soon to send the enemy rushing
for the stronghold. The pursuing horsemen arrived
at the causeway as soon as the fugitives; here they
were obliged to dismount, as the place was impassable
for horses; yet they followed the Indians so closely
that no time was given to destroy the bridges, and
the Spaniards entered the fort with them. The
infantry soon came up, and though the Zutugils
struggled desperately to maintain their position, the
volleys of the arquebusiers made such havoc in their
ranks that at last they plunged into the lake and
swam to a neighboring island, whence many of them
escaped before the tardy arrival of three hundred
Cakchiquel canoes.
</p>

<p>
That evening, after sacking all the houses on the
rock, Alvarado pitched his camp in a field of maize.
On the following morning he implored divine protection
and marched against Atitlan. He found the city
abandoned, his capture of what they regarded as an
impregnable stronghold in the lake having so discomfited
the Zutugils that they dared not contend with
him for their city. At mid-day he took up position
in the capital, and at once set about to overrun and
devastate the country; but it was so rugged that the
men could with difficulty move, and he was obliged to
content himself with destroying some plantations of
maize and cacao.<a id='FA_XXV-18' href='#FN_XXV-18' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-18]</a> He succeeded in making a few
captives, three of whom were despatched to King
Tepepul with the usual demand of submission, accompanied
by threats in case of refusal. Perceiving the
necessity, the Zutugil monarch gracefully yielded,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_660' href='#Page_660'>660</a></span>
whereupon the conqueror became gracious. He complimented
the Zutugils for their bravery, pardoned
their offences, and exhorted them to remain faithful,
and to make no more war on such of their neighbors
as were the recognized subjects of the king of Spain.
To give efficacy to his words he built a strong fort in
a suitable position, and left in it four hundred and
eighteen men, Spaniards and Mexican allies, under
the command of Héctor de Chaves and Alonso del
Pulgar. Then he returned to Patinamit.<a id='FA_XXV-19' href='#FN_XXV-19' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-19]</a>
</p>

<p>
Within three days the lords of the lake district
presented themselves, with presents of gold and raiment.
They expressed joy at becoming vassals of his
majesty of Spain, for wars and woes should thenceforth
be unknown among them. The Spanish commander
was extremely affable as he presented his
visitors with some glass trinkets, of great value in
their eyes, and dismissed them with every demonstration
of affection.<a id='FA_XXV-20' href='#FN_XXV-20' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-20]</a>
</p>

<p class="p2">
Perhaps one reason why the play of Helen of Troy
was not oftener performed by the Spanish conquerors
in America was on account of the cheapness of women
there. There might be lacking gold, or pearls, or
provender, but seldom was a people found so poor that
they could not furnish the army a liberal supply of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_661' href='#Page_661'>661</a></span>
pretty slave girls. Less is found in the chronicles of
this kind of traffic than of the traffic in gold and the
traffic in pearls. The merchandise of morality, or
rather of immorality, was less portable than the other
kinds. Women were to use and throw away; gold
would keep; while pearls were usually a staple article
in the Spanish nation.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">ALVARADO IN LOVE.</div>

<p>
Now the pious Alvarado, next to his delectable
master Cortés the most pious pirate in all the Indies,
had tasted every iniquity condemned in his most holy
scriptures except that invented and acted by the sweet
psalmist of Israel. He had severally broken every
commandment of the decalogue, then he had put them
together and had broken them in every conceivable
combination. But while maidens were so plump and
plenty he had never felt the desire, like good King
David, to go after the wife of any Uriah the Hittite.
But while enjoying the luxurious hospitality of the
Cakchiquel capital, with a world to give for a new
sensation, Alvarado's eye fell on the beautiful Suchil,<a id='FA_XXV-21' href='#FN_XXV-21' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-21]</a>
wife of King Sinacam. In some respects it was the
Israelitish tale reversed, for Sinacam was by no means
a poor man in respect of women, nor was Suchil his
only ewe lamb. The susceptible heart of the dashing
commander was smitten by the graces of this queen,
and he resolved to possess her. Being a conqueror,
with a king for a slave, he might have obtained his
desire by the simple demand; but in those days there
was something sacred in royalty, even in heathen and
captive royalty. Sinacam was now an acknowledged
subject of Spain, and as such possessed rights; besides,
that was not the way set forth by the bright exemplar
of his faith.
</p>

<p>
Upon some pretext, therefore, Sinacam was arrested
and put in irons. Gold was then demanded, and yet
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_662' href='#Page_662'>662</a></span>
more gold. It was the old method of making the
penalty supply the place of guilt and condemnation.
Then Suchil was seized, I do not say unwillingly, for
the Spanish commander was fair and fascinating, and
the Cakchiquel queen was after all but a woman.
Above all things on earth, or beyond the earth, Sinacam
regarded her—and for her restoration he offered
more jewels, and pretty maidens, ay, the daughters of
chieftains, by the hundred. Alvarado refused the
prayer but not the offering. When love had cooled
he released the king and went his way.<a id='FA_XXV-22' href='#FN_XXV-22' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-22]</a>

<div class="sidenote">CONQUEST OF ITZCUINTLAN.</div>

<p>
While receiving at Patinamit, after the Zutugil
campaign, the fealty of numerous chieftains of the
southern coast provinces, Alvarado was told that the
district of Itzcuintlan<a id='FA_XXVI-1' href='#FN_XXVI-1' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-1]</a> defied him. And with their refusal
to accept the benefits of Christian civilization certain
irritating expressions of contempt were reported
to have been uttered by the ruler of the province.
Chiefs of other tribes who wished to pass through it,
in order to tender allegiance to the Spaniards, were
deterred and insulted, and the conqueror was challenged
to enter the land.<a id='FA_XXVI-2' href='#FN_XXVI-2' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-2]</a> Somewhat ruffled by these
bold proceedings, the impetuous commander marched
against Itzcuintlan with all his available force, Spanish
horse and foot, and a large body of Quichés and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_664' href='#Page_664'>664</a></span>
Cakchiquels.<a id='FA_XXVI-3' href='#FN_XXVI-3' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-3]</a> It was a very rough country through
which he had to pass. Roads there were none, other
than mere tracks through the thick woods, for intercourse
with Itzcuintlan had been almost entirely
closed, owing to incessant war; but these circumstances
favored a secret entrance into the hostile territory.
For three days they forced their way through an
uninhabitable tract almost closed to man by tropical
undergrowth, which required constant application of
axe and knife, so that one day they were unable to
proceed more than two leagues. On reaching the
province it was found covered with thick plantations
alternating with swamps. Such ground being no place
for horses, the arquebusiers took the front, and advanced
upon the town from three different quarters.
It was raining heavily at the time, a shower preliminary
to the season of rain, and the sentinels had
retired, so that the surprise was complete.<a id='FA_XXVI-4' href='#FN_XXVI-4' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-4]</a> Unable
to arm or unite, the inhabitants fled to the woods to
escape the swords of the conquerors. In the fort,
however, which commanded the town, a considerable
body of warriors had gathered, who offered a determined
resistance, wounding many Spaniards and
causing great loss to the Indian auxiliaries. After five
hours of unavailing attempts to gain possession of the
stronghold, the enraged Alvarado set fire to the place.
The brave defenders appear to have escaped, thanks
to the heavy rain and the proximity of the surrounding
woods. Indeed, according to Alvarado's own
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_665' href='#Page_665'>665</a></span>
statement, he did no harm beyond burning the town.<a id='FA_XXVI-5' href='#FN_XXVI-5' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-5]</a>
The subjection of the district was not yet accomplished,
however, and messengers were sent to the ruler with
the usual summons and threats. If they persisted
in keeping aloof and refusing to submit, their lands
and cornfields would be devastated, and they and
their children made slaves. This menace had the
desired effect; the cacique and his chiefs submitted
and swore obedience, and during the eight days Alvarado
remained in this place a number of the surrounding
towns sent in their allegiance. But the restless
spirit of both leader and men was not to be satisfied
with the subjugation of one province only. The lieutenant-general
had heard exciting accounts of immense
cities and wonderful palaces, and discovery was almost
as attractive to him as pacification. He had already
informed Cortés that it was his intention to winter
fifty or one hundred leagues beyond Guatemala. As
an additional incentive he had received positive information
that a march of twenty-five days from Guatemala
would bring him to the end of the land: if that
should prove to be the case he was confident of finding
soon the famous strait, for which so many were
searching.<a id='FA_XXVI-6' href='#FN_XXVI-6' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-6]</a> Besides the strait he desired also to find a
harbor where he could construct vessels for exploring
the coast at a later date. Already a great soldier, he
desired to become also a great discoverer. Even the
rainy season, which has just set in, should not deter
him, though his difficulties would be greatly increased
thereby.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">TOWNS TAKEN.</div>

<p>
Starting southward, then, from Itzcuintlan, the
first difficulty encountered by the army was the River
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_666' href='#Page_666'>666</a></span>
Michatoyat,<a id='FA_XXVI-7' href='#FN_XXVI-7' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-7]</a> which could be crossed only by bridging.
The first town reached was Atiquipac,<a id='FA_XXVI-8' href='#FN_XXVI-8' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-8]</a> where the Spaniards
were amicably received, but at sunset the people
abandoned their homes and fled to the mountains.<a id='FA_XXVI-9' href='#FN_XXVI-9' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-9]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_667' href='#Page_667'>667</a></span>
There was no time to be wasted with them, for the
roads might at any time be rendered impassable by the
rains, and so the army pushed forward after branding
a few unfortunates as slaves,<a id='FA_XXVI-10' href='#FN_XXVI-10' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-10]</a> the commander taking
every precaution in the disposition of his forces for the
security of baggage and the protection of the auxiliaries.
The next town reached was Tacuylula, standing
to-day under the same name. The reception here was
similar to the former, except, perhaps, that the natives
detected the quality of their visitors more quickly than
did the people of Atiquipac. Within an hour they had
all fled.<a id='FA_XXVI-11' href='#FN_XXVI-11' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-11]</a>
</p>

<p>
From Tacuylula they advanced to Taxisco, where,
according to Alvarado's report, the inhabitants appeared
friendly.<a id='FA_XXVI-12' href='#FN_XXVI-12' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-12]</a> They passed the night in the town,
with every precaution against attack, for it was strong
and populous, and the Spaniards were under no little
apprehension of an assault. They were unmolested,
however, and left on the following morning for the
town of Nancintlan.<a id='FA_XXVI-13' href='#FN_XXVI-13' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-13]</a> For better security the commander
placed ten horsemen in the rear and an equal
number in the centre with his baggage, while with
the remainder of the cavalry he led the van. He had
advanced between two and three leagues when a fierce
assault was made upon his rear, wherein a number
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_668' href='#Page_668'>668</a></span>
of his Indian allies were killed, and, what he deplored
still more, a great quantity of his baggage, stores,
and material was carried off.<a id='FA_XXVI-14' href='#FN_XXVI-14' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-14]</a>
</p>

<p>
This was a grave loss, and the commander immediately
sent his brother, Jorge Alvarado, with forty
or fifty of the cavalry to attempt a recapture. On
arriving at the scene of the late disaster this officer
fell in with a large body of warriors<a id='FA_XXVI-15' href='#FN_XXVI-15' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-15]</a> and put them to
flight, but recovered none of the lost effects. In the
mean time the army arrived at Nancintlan, and Jorge
Alvarado having returned with little or nothing accomplished,
Puertocarrero<a id='FA_XXVI-16' href='#FN_XXVI-16' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-16]</a> was sent back with a detachment
of foot-soldiers. The second attempt was
as unsuccessful as the first. The fact is, the country
was all in arms; the natives had retired to mountain
fastnesses, whence they issued forth to attack as occasion
offered. Nancintlan had also been abandoned, save
by the principal men who were detained as prisoners.
During the eight days' stay<a id='FA_XXVI-17' href='#FN_XXVI-17' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-17]</a> here, Alvarado sought in
vain to induce the people to return, and, as he could
delay his march no longer, out of pure spite the dastardly
commander burned the town and his prisoners.<a id='FA_XXVI-18' href='#FN_XXVI-18' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-18]</a>
</p>

<p>
The Spaniards now advanced to the neighboring
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_669' href='#Page_669'>669</a></span>
town of Pazaco.<a id='FA_XXVI-19' href='#FN_XXVI-19' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-19]</a> The lieutenant-general had already
received an invitation from the chiefs, with protestations
of friendship, which could hardly have been
sincere, for as the Spaniards approached the town
their advance was interrupted by short poisoned stakes,
ingeniously hidden in the ground.<a id='FA_XXVI-20' href='#FN_XXVI-20' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-20]</a> The roads, also,
were found to be closed near the town, with all possible
impediments to an advance. As they entered
the place, the spectacle of a canine sacrifice, a ceremonial
significant of hatred and defiance, met their
gaze.<a id='FA_XXVI-21' href='#FN_XXVI-21' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-21]</a> Nor were hostilities long delayed. At a signal
the natives suddenly appeared, shouting their shrill
war-cries, and threw upon the Spaniards so heavy a
discharge of arrows, lances, and stones, that it was
with difficulty they held their ground. Slowly but
surely, however, Spanish weapons and coats of mail
prevailed, and the Indians, unable to stand before
them, fled to the surrounding heights, amidst the
attendant horrors of pursuit.<a id='FA_XXVI-22' href='#FN_XXVI-22' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-22]</a>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">ACROSS LA PAZA INTO SALVADOR.</div>

<p>
The army thereupon passed across the La Paz
River<a id='FA_XXVI-23' href='#FN_XXVI-23' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-23]</a> into what is now the state of Salvador, first
entering Moquizalco,<a id='FA_XXVI-24' href='#FN_XXVI-24' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-24]</a> and then they went to Acatepec.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_670' href='#Page_670'>670</a></span>
Both of these towns received the strangers hospitably,
but the inhabitants soon fled, overcome by terror at
the cruelties committed. Angered by this continual
desertion, Alvarado ordered the Indians to be pursued,
and as many of them as could be seized were
branded as slaves. He then hastened forward, directing
his march to Acajutla.<a id='FA_XXVI-25' href='#FN_XXVI-25' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-25]</a> On arriving within half
a league of the town he encountered a mighty host
drawn up in battle array to oppose him, their ranks
extending over a wide plain that lay before the city.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_671' href='#Page_671'>671</a></span>
It was indeed an inspiriting sight for an Indian fighter.
Times had been somewhat tame for the last few days,
but here was the promise of rare sport, indeed. Alvarado,
who was in advance with the cavalry,
approached to within a cross-bow shot, and then
halted for his infantry to come up. As he ran his
experienced eye over the forests of spears, and marked
the magnitude of the hostile array, he felt that all
his coolness and all his skill would be required to save
his army that day. War plumes waved from the
heads of thousands, and battle devices were scattered
as far as the eye could reach, while the feathered
banners floating above the parti-colored bands threw
over all an air of peculiar brilliance.<a id='FA_XXVI-26' href='#FN_XXVI-26' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-26]</a> The foe had
chosen, too, an advantageous position. In their rear
thick woods offered easy refuge in case of need. Yet
already, before they were his own, Alvarado began to
plan that none should escape him. He stood there
like a hunter overlooking a band of antelope, and
thinking how he could best secure them all. Of what
advantage was it to Charles, or Cortés, or even to
these panting wolves themselves, that this ill fated
multitude to the last man should die?

<p>
As the remainder of his forces<a id='FA_XXVI-27' href='#FN_XXVI-27' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-27]</a> came up, Alvarado
advanced a little nearer to the enemy. The Indians
manifested no inclination to leave their position; they
appeared to be awaiting attack. Alvarado then feigned
retreat, which the army performed in perfect order,
though in apparent haste,<a id='FA_XXVI-28' href='#FN_XXVI-28' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-28]</a> the commander himself
having charge of the rear. The result was as he
anticipated. The duped natives eagerly pursued; at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_672' href='#Page_672'>672</a></span>
last, they thought, these beings maledict are afraid.
And they flew at them with wild demonstrations of
joy at the expected victory, making in their onset
such a roar as would have appalled any but veteran
troops. In their blind enthusiasm they grappled and
struggled with the retiring cavalry, seizing the horses'
tails and the riders' stirrups. Their arrows rattled
thick like hailstones against the metal armor of the
soldiers, or with angry hiss passed them by, reaching
to the farthest end of the Spanish army. For some
time this movement continued over the level plain,
on which no obstacle interposed to prevent its successful
achievement.<a id='FA_XXVI-29' href='#FN_XXVI-29' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-29]</a> After thus drawing the enemy
away from the friendly wood, and to such ground
as best suited the purpose, the order was given; the
Spanish army wheeled and fell on the unprepared foe
like a storm of Sodom. Sennacherib's hosts before
Jerusalem met no more complete destruction than
the army of warriors before Acajutla that day. Incased
in cumbersome cotton armor, they could not flee,
and when overthrown by the charging horsemen they
could not rise again.<a id='FA_XXVI-30' href='#FN_XXVI-30' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-30]</a> As they lay helpless on the
ground the infantry and auxiliaries would cut and
pierce them as if they had been swine, following as
zealously as possible the example of Alvarado, who,
severely wounded<a id='FA_XXVI-31' href='#FN_XXVI-31' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-31]</a> and out of humor, vented his
malignant spleen upon these home-defenders. Ah!
war is a glorious thing; and grand that civilization
which refines and ennobles war!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_673' href='#Page_673'>673</a></span>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">ANOTHER GREAT BATTLE.</div>

<p>
The revenge of the chivalrous commander was ample;
not one of all that multitude of warriors was left
alive upon the field.<a id='FA_XXVI-32' href='#FN_XXVI-32' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-32]</a> When the extermination was
finished the victorious army entered Acajutla, and
remained there five days caring for their wounded, of
whom there was a great number; then they passed
on to Tacuxcalco.<a id='FA_XXVI-33' href='#FN_XXVI-33' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-33]</a> Pedro Puertocarrero had been
sent forward to reconnoitre, and succeeded in capturing
two spies, who reported that the warriors of
this town and its dependencies were assembled in
large numbers to oppose their advance, whereupon the
scouting party proceeded until they arrived within
sight of the enemy. Gonzalo de Alvarado, who led
the van, his brother being ill of his wound, presently
came up with forty of the cavalry, and drew up in
order, waiting for the main body to arrive. The commander,
though still suffering severely, mounted a
horse as best he could and issued his orders. The
Indians were drawn up in one solid phalanx; he would
assail them on three sides at once. Thirty of the
cavalry, under the command of Gonzalo de Alvarado,
were to attack the right, his brother Gomez was ordered
to lead twenty more against the left, while Jorge<a id='FA_XXVI-34' href='#FN_XXVI-34' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-34]</a> was
to charge the front with the rest of the forces.
</p>

<p>
These arrangements made, he took his post on elevated
ground above the battle field. Even his stout
heart sank somewhat within him as he viewed the
scene. One portion of the plain was covered with a
forest of tall spears,<a id='FA_XXVI-35' href='#FN_XXVI-35' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-35]</a> and the compact body of foemen
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_674' href='#Page_674'>674</a></span>
told him that they were even more numerous than
the army he had defeated a few days before.<a id='FA_XXVI-36' href='#FN_XXVI-36' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-36]</a> His
apprehensions were in no wise lessened as he watched
his forces draw near the enemy and observed how
immovable they stood, and without sign of fear. But
what seemed to him most strange was that his own
men hesitated to charge. He afterward ascertained
that between the opposing lines lay a narrow meadow
which the Spaniards mistook for a swamp, and delayed
their onset until they had assured themselves of the
firmness of the ground. Presently the stirring cry of
Santiago! was heard, and Alvarado's heart swelled
within him: his passion for human blood appears to
increase with the slaughter of his tens of thousands,
and the lately gay and gallant cavalier is becoming a
monster delighting in carnage and butchery, killing
men for the mere pleasure of it. With a feeling
of fierce delight the wounded man now watched his
army break into the Indian columns. He marked the
rout and bloody pursuit, and noticed with satisfaction
how the plain became streaked with dead bodies in
the track of the fugitives and pursuers, which ghastly
line was soon over a league in length.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">MARCH ON CUZCATLAN.</div>

<p>
Taking possession of the town, the Spaniards remained
in it for two days, and then moved on to
Mihuatlan.<a id='FA_XXVI-37' href='#FN_XXVI-37' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-37]</a> All the towns and villages hereabout
were found deserted; the natives seemed to have discovered
that there was no chance of success in the
field, and no escape from oppression when once their
liberty was lost. At Atecuan<a id='FA_XXVI-38' href='#FN_XXVI-38' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-38]</a> the commander was
met by envoys from Atlacatl, the king of Cuzcatlan,
bearing proffers of friendship, which were received
with satisfaction, for the delay and fatigue of battle
with the reward of empty towns, however pleasurable,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_675' href='#Page_675'>675</a></span>
seemed profitless.<a id='FA_XXVI-39' href='#FN_XXVI-39' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-39]</a> So far, indeed, Alvarado
seems to have effected little with respect to the actual
conquest of the country. His line of march was
marked by heaps of slain, by burned cities and
deserted villages,<a id='FA_XXVI-40' href='#FN_XXVI-40' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-40]</a> but as for native subjects of his
Majesty, or Christian converts, or colonies, or any
permanent advantages, they were few. If, now in the
very heart of the country, he could gain a faithful
ally, a second Sinacam, pacification might become
more permanent and profitable. To this end he directed
his march toward Cuzcatlan,<a id='FA_XXVI-41' href='#FN_XXVI-41' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-41]</a> the capital of
that country, a large and beautiful city, inhabited by
a considerable population, and, according to the report
of the conquerors, hardly second to Patinamit.
</p>

<p>
Although the Indians along the road manifested
their friendliness by supplying the Spaniards with
fruits and fresh provisions in abundance, and although
they were cordially welcomed into the city by the
chiefs, yet on taking up their quarters the whole
population rushed to arms, and a few hours after the
city was deserted.<a id='FA_XXVI-42' href='#FN_XXVI-42' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-42]</a> All efforts at reconciliation on
the part of Alvarado were unavailing. Summons to
obedience and menaces were equally disregarded, and
a formal requirement was sent, coupled with the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_676' href='#Page_676'>676</a></span>
usual conditions; but no reply came. Then the invaders
tried force, but for once they were baffled.
For fully seventeen days the most strenuous exertions
were made to subdue them, during which time several
sanguinary encounters occurred, wherein a number of
Spaniards were wounded and eleven horses killed, the
auxiliaries suffering severely. Thus even the occupation
of the capital failed to secure the primary object
of the invasion.
</p>

<p>
Alvarado now perceived that with the present
force he never would be able to subjugate these Cuzcatecs,
and he saw that his position was becoming
critical. The rainy season was now well upon him,
the roads were becoming bad, and every day would
render retreat more difficult. The return march extended
over several hundred miles, and he could not
expect to meet with much hospitality or assistance.
He decided, therefore, to return to Guatemala. But
before he set out he would make legally secure his
claim upon the vassalage of the Cuzcatecs. With
this view he instituted a process against them in the
form prescribed by law, and summoned them to surrender.
As no attention was paid to his proclamation,
proceedings were closed after the legal time had expired
and sentence was passed. They were pronounced
traitors and their chiefs condemned to death.<a id='FA_XXVI-43' href='#FN_XXVI-43' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-43]</a>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHRISTIANIZING AND BRANDING.</div>

<p>
This solemn ceremony ended,<a id='FA_XXVI-44' href='#FN_XXVI-44' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-44]</a> Alvarado was ready
to depart from the country, though not till he had
branded all he could lay hands upon. He was somewhat
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_677' href='#Page_677'>677</a></span>
chagrined at his failure to draw the Cuzcatecs
into the fold; but he would return again. Indeed,
this was imperative, for the Cuzcatlan campaign had
been quite unproductive<a id='FA_XXVI-45' href='#FN_XXVI-45' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-45]</a> in securing either wealth or
dominion. From Itzcuintlan to Cuzcatlan there was
scarcely a town that would not require a second subjugation.
An additional cause of vexation lay in the
statement of natives that no strait existed toward the
south.<a id='FA_XXVI-46' href='#FN_XXVI-46' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-46]</a> On the other hand he was gratified to learn
of great cities beyond, built of stone and lime, and
inhabited by dense populations, and he promised himself
due compensation from them for his present disappointment.
Of his homeward march particulars
are unnecessary. That the way was difficult and
that the soldiers suffered much we may be sure.<a id='FA_XXVI-47' href='#FN_XXVI-47' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-47]</a>
Pinched by hunger, drenched by rain, midst the lightning
and the thunder, they beat their way back
over the soft soaked ground, braving the heavens and
the earth which seemed to have risen against them.
At night, if no deserted town afforded shelter, the
worn-out men, after partaking of scanty fare and
shivering in wet clothes round feeble camp fires, threw
themselves upon the swampy ground to sleep. Yet
with all their sufferings they did not scruple to destroy
fields, burn such villages as fell in their way, and so
reduce others to the same sad plight as themselves.
Sweet to us are the misfortunes of others!

<p>
Pedro de Alvarado with his army arrived at Patinamit
from his southern campaign some days previous
to the 28th of July, 1524.<a id='FA_XXVII-1' href='#FN_XXVII-1' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-1]</a> The Mexican allies were
soon dismissed and returned to their homes, bearing
despatches to Cortés. The general was greatly pleased
with the tidings from his lieutenant, and sent him two
hundred more Spanish soldiers, to aid in the colonization
of those parts.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">FOUNDING OF THE CITY OF SANTIAGO.</div>

<p>
Almost immediately after their return to the capital
of the Cakchiquels the Spaniards proceeded to
appropriate the territory and make preparations for
its government. A Spanish city was founded at
Patinamit under the name of Ciudad del Señor de
Santiago.<a id='FA_XXVII-2' href='#FN_XXVII-2' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-2]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_679' href='#Page_679'>679</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The ceremonies were conducted with great pomp.
According to Remesal, on the 25th of July, St James'
day, the army was drawn up in battle-array to the
sound of fife and drum. The morning was unusually
fine, and the sun flashing its rays upon burnished
armor added splendor to the scene. The cavalry were
specially conspicuous for the brilliancy of their dress
and ornaments. After repeated volleys by the arquebusiers
mass was celebrated by Juan Godinez, the
chaplain, and all joined devoutly in the service. With
due ceremony the new town was dedicated to their
patron Santiago.
</p>

<p>
The municipal officers were then appointed by
Alvarado. The first alcaldes were Diego de Rojas
and Baltasar de Mendoza. Four regidores were nominated,
whose names were Pedro Puertocarrero,
Hernan Carrillo, Juan Perez Dardon, and Domingo
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_680' href='#Page_680'>680</a></span>
de Zubiarreta,<a id='FA_XXVII-3' href='#FN_XXVII-3' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-3]</a> while Gonzalo de Alvarado was elected
alguacil mayor.<a id='FA_XXVII-4' href='#FN_XXVII-4' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-4]</a>
</p>

<p>
The municipality having thus been formed,<a id='FA_XXVII-5' href='#FN_XXVII-5' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-5]</a> the
Spaniards for the next three days devoted themselves
to festivities and rejoicing. On the 12th of August<a id='FA_XXVII-6' href='#FN_XXVII-6' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-6]</a>
there was an enrolment of colonists, of whom a list
of one hundred has been preserved.<a id='FA_XXVII-7' href='#FN_XXVII-7' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-7]</a> To the sacred
patron was also built and dedicated a church, of which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_681' href='#Page_681'>681</a></span>
Juan Godinez was left in charge, and one Reynosa
sacristan with a salary of sixty dollars a year. The surrounding
lands were then distributed in encomiendas.
In making these grants Alvarado must have entertained
some misgivings as to their validity and as to his
future position and authority in the conquered provinces,
for in a despatch to Cortés he complains that according
to reports meeting him on his return from the
southern campaign the king had appointed a governor
other than himself of the new territory, and upbraids
Cortés for not having duly reported his services to
his Majesty, at the same time begging him to do so.<a id='FA_XXVII-8' href='#FN_XXVII-8' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-8]</a>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">OUTRAGE UPON OUTRAGE.</div>

<p>
That the Cakchiquel nobles should regard with
indignation this arbitrary disposal of their lands and
vassals was but natural. They had already observed
that friend and foe were much the same in the hands
of the voracious Spaniards, whose aggressive and
outrageous action now convinced them that the
friendly bearing of their king had gained for their
nation no more, nay less, consideration than that
vouchsafed the conquered Quichés, who had fought
manfully for independence. So it was, in truth, with
regard to all the conquerors in America, though not so
expressed in words: those who fought for their rights
must die or suffer enslavement because they offered
opposition to the spoilers; those who did not fight
were contemptible things, unworthy a white man's
consideration. Believing in their promises, the Cakchiquels
had received the Spaniards and had accepted
their sovereign; but they were not prepared to go so
far as to surrender themselves, their wives and little
ones, their lands and their religion. Death might be
the result of revolt; judging from what they had seen
it probably would be; nevertheless they would revolt
and die. How high the high hand of the taskmasters
had been raised we know not; but we know that within
a few short months after Alvarado's return and the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_682' href='#Page_682'>682</a></span>
founding of his unstable city<a id='FA_XXVII-9' href='#FN_XXVII-9' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-9]</a> the Cakchiquels rose to
a man against the tyrants. The crowning grievance
also is known. Exaction after exaction had been
made. The temples and palaces of Patinamit had
been forced to contribute their gold and silver ornaments
until there was nothing left. Then a large
amount of gold<a id='FA_XXVII-10' href='#FN_XXVII-10' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-10]</a> was demanded of the king and nobles
within a stated time, which it was out of their power
to supply. In their efforts to obtain the so much
desired yellow substance from auriferous streams
they brought in glittering pyrites, mistaking them for
gold.<a id='FA_XXVII-11' href='#FN_XXVII-11' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-11]</a> Alvarado, furious with rage, summoned the
king and his courtiers before him. "Why," he passionately
exclaimed, "have you not brought the gold and
silver that I demanded of you? If I receive not soon
all the gold and all the silver of your towns, you shall
have the choice of being hanged or burned alive!"
Then with a brutality that Caligula might have gloried
in he tore with his own hand from the nostrils of
Sinacam and two princes at his side the golden ornaments
they wore as badges of their high rank.<a id='FA_XXVII-12' href='#FN_XXVII-12' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-12]</a> This
indignity cut the unhappy natives to the heart, and
bending their disgraced heads, bitter tears mingled
with the blood which fell at the feet of the Christian.
"It is my will," added Alvarado, "that the
gold and silver be here within five days. Woe betide
you if you bring it not!" and with a coarseness that
equalled his heartlessness he dismissed them from his
presence.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_683' href='#Page_683'>683</a></span>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">ABANDONMENT OF THE CITY.</div>

<p>
Nobles, priesthood, and people were already of one
mind. The priests in particular, seeing the desecration
of their temples and the threatened suppression
of their religion, put forth all their efforts to rouse
the Cakchiquels from the vile thraldom. And while
the nobles and people proceeded as best they were
able to collect treasures to meet the last demand
from the neighboring towns, the priesthood succeeded
in completing plans and preparations for revolt. They
spread the report that their deity, offended at the sacrilegious
actions of the Spaniards, had appeared to
his ministers, announcing the speedy destruction of
the strangers. A priest of Chamalcan now presented
himself before Sinacam and his court. "I am the
lightning!" he cried, with subdued vehemence, "and I
will strike the Castilians. With fire will I destroy
them! When I shall cause the sound of the sacred
drum to be heard in the city, let the king leave it
and withdraw to the other side of the river, for on
the seventh day, Ahmak, will I strike the Spaniards!"
These bold and confident words had their effect. In
their deep affliction the Cakchiquels believed their
god would help them, else of what value were gods?
and they secretly made all ready for the time the
signal should be given. The Spaniards do not seem
to have had any suspicion of the intentions of the
Cakchiquels. On the very evening of the uprising
Alvarado, pacified with the gold that had been
brought him, entertained Sinacam and a large number
of princes and nobles at a banquet, a splendid banquet,
whereat the guests feasted on their own of
which they had been despoiled. That night, while
the Spaniards were asleep, heavy after their revelry,
the signal drum was sounded. The whole population,
men, women, and children, arose and silently withdrew
with their king and nobles from the city. It is not
the only time in the world's history that a people have
abandoned home and fled from persecution, trusting
in religious faith. Now may the god in whom they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_684' href='#Page_684'>684</a></span>
trust help them, for all other hope they have left
behind! Crossing the ravine they turned and awaited
the expected miracle; all through the remainder of
the night they watched for the lightning and the fire,
straining their eyes afar, to the remotest corners of the
heavens, to catch the first faint gleam of that sacred
flame which should bring them deliverance. But
alas! there was no light save that of the morning sun,
which came to dispel all hope. God and priest alike
had deceived them; or rather they themselves were
deceived, had not understood aright, or were not
worthy of aid, or their desire would come in some
other way—so their teacher might have said. Now
it remained only for them to perish, for they would
return, never!<a id='FA_XXVII-13' href='#FN_XXVII-13' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-13]</a>
</p>

<p>
Alvarado well knew the meaning of this action
when he heard of it. And as he walked through
the city, the empty houses and deserted streets told
him plainly enough that his atrocious system of oppression
had driven to despair a nation that had
welcomed him with all kindness and hospitality. The
immediate cause and incentive to revolt, the action
of the priest, being explained to him, he hoped when
the Cakchiquels had discovered how vain was the
hope in their god that they would return to their
homes again, and for ten days he remained inactive.
But all attempts at reconciliation were repelled; they
would rather die at war with the Christians than
live at peace with them. Ah well! then they must
be slain; and as a religious and patriotic duty Alvarado
took the field against them. It was a long
and bloody war that followed. If the Quichés and
Zutugils had confederated with the Cakchiquels,
it is safe to surmise the Spaniards would have been
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_685' href='#Page_685'>685</a></span>
repelled. With a scarcity of provisions,<a id='FA_XXVII-14' href='#FN_XXVII-14' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-14]</a> and a reduced
number of Mexican auxiliaries, hemmed in
and harassed, it is hardly possible that they could
have fought their way out of the country. But the
rejection by Sinacam of the earlier proposals of the
Quichés, and his alliance with the invaders, still
rankled in their breasts, and they now cared little
which of their detested foes ate the other. As it
was, the war proved not the one-sided affair of late
so common. The Cakchiquels displayed a skill and
bravery in battle such as the Spaniards had not experienced
in these parts. In front of their lines they
dug deep holes in which they planted pointed stakes,
and concealing them with coverings of grass and light
earth, received behind them the charging cavalry.
Many a Spaniard and many a horse found death or
frightful wounds, impaled in these pitfalls.<a id='FA_XXVII-15' href='#FN_XXVII-15' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-15]</a>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">HATRED OF THE CAKCHIQUELS.</div>

<p>
On the battle-field the natives displayed a desperate
courage. With their deep hatred they would if possible
envenom their arrows and darts, and as they hurled
them on the foe they shouted, "Take gold, Tonatiuh,
take gold!" Thus the contest was carried on with
great animosity on both sides, and the Cakchiquels,
now more united among themselves, and joined by
many neighboring tribes, long maintained the struggle.
Though their own land suffered from the ravages of
the Spaniards, they had their revenge in devastating
the territories of the Quichés and Zutugils; for these
nations had been so weakened in their contests with
the Spaniards that they could no longer meet the
Cakchiquels in the field. And, indeed, under this
widely extended process of devastation the Spaniards
began to suffer hunger. Alvarado was obliged to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_686' href='#Page_686'>686</a></span>
abandon his new city at Patinamit during the latter
part of this year, 1524, and to make his head-quarters
for a time at Xepau,<a id='FA_XXVII-16' href='#FN_XXVII-16' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-16]</a> round which the country was
less desolate.
</p>

<p>
The Spaniards were indeed sorely pressed, and
many Christians were killed and wounded. But about
the beginning of 1525 he received reinforcements from
Mexico which enabled him to proceed rapidly with
the reduction of the revolted provinces. Returning
to Patinamit, he subjected the several districts one
after another to fire and sword, till the land was one
wide scene of desolation.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">CAMPAIGN AGAINST MIXCO.</div>

<p class="p2">
It was during, or immediately after, the suppression
of this revolt that the Spaniards accomplished perhaps
their greatest achievement during the whole Guatemalan
conquest. This was the storming of the city
of Mixco, deemed impregnable.<a id='FA_XXVII-17' href='#FN_XXVII-17' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-17]</a> Mixco was one of
the most important strongholds in the Cakchiquel
kingdom, being so fortified by nature as to require
little from art. Situated on an eminence surrounded
on all sides by precipices, it was accessible only by a
steep path, wide enough for but a single person, and
interrupted here and there by places which could only
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_687' href='#Page_687'>687</a></span>
with difficulty be climbed.<a id='FA_XXVII-18' href='#FN_XXVII-18' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-18]</a> On the top of this
eminence was a great plain, capable of supporting a
population of eight or nine thousand.
</p>

<p>
Learning that the Mixcans had determined to resist
Spanish rule, and were encouraging other tribes to
fortify themselves in similar impregnable positions,
Alvarado regarded the reduction of the place as an
absolute necessity. He therefore sent an advance
force of two companies of foot-soldiers and one of
cavalry, under the command of his brother Gonzalo,
to invest Mixco until he should be able to assume
command in person. The captains commanding under
Gonzalo, Alonso de Ojeda, Luis de Vivar, and Hernando
de Chaves, were men of high courage and experience;
yet they not only accomplished nothing, but
suffered so much from the stones and arrows of the
enemy,<a id='FA_XXVII-19' href='#FN_XXVII-19' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-19]</a> provisions likewise beginning to fail, that Gonzalo
was about to raise the siege when the lieutenant-general
arrived with reinforcements.<a id='FA_XXVII-20' href='#FN_XXVII-20' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-20]</a> Although fully
recognizing the difficulty and danger of the undertaking
there were two incentives which urged Alvarado
forward to its achievement: he loved what was difficult
and dangerous, and he well knew that there could
be no permanent subjugation of the country with this
stronghold in the hands of the enemy. A council of
war was held and the capture of Mixco resolved on.
The first attempt was unsuccessful, as were indeed the
second and third, until days and weeks went by without
any seeming progress. Then the Spaniards tried
stratagem, and while feigning an assault by means of
scaling-ladders at a place where the precipice was lower
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_688' href='#Page_688'>688</a></span>
than elsewhere, they suddenly made a rush up the
pathway, which they hoped to find undefended. The
Mixcans were prepared, however, and received the
Spaniards with such heavy discharges of missiles that
they were forced to retire in confusion. While the
officers were in consultation shortly after, a strong
body of native warriors was reported near at hand,
which proved to be Chignautecs, allies of the Mixcans.<a id='FA_XXVII-21' href='#FN_XXVII-21' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-21]</a>
Their intentions were evident, and soon the
two armies were engaged in hot contest. Notwithstanding
that great havoc was made by the arquebuses
and cross-bows, and still more by the cavalry, the Chignautecs
maintained the fight with such stubbornness
that after the loss of a large number of Tlascaltecs
and the wounding of many Spaniards a retrograde
movement was decided on.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">FIGHT WITH THE CHIGNAUTECS.</div>

<p>
Upon an occasion like the present, where the
object to be gained, the taking of a stronghold,
partook more of the nature of single combat than
of general battle, here and elsewhere upon a campaign
of this kind, it was not uncommon to see feats
of individual prowess cropping out on both sides. It
was the field of glory to the soldier, limited usually
to the field, as the world was the general's field of
glory. I will mention one such exhibition in connection
with this fight against the Chignautecs. In the
hazardous retreat one of the cavalrymen, García de
Aguilar, is in the extreme rear, subject to the
fiercest assaults of the pursuing warriors. In truth,
his body is interposed between the two contending
armies. Obviously, if the enemy cannot put him
out of the way they are unable to harm the others;
every effort is therefore made to maim his horse, or
otherwise to capture him; and he is at length cut
off from his comrades and quickly surrounded by
over four hundred of the dusky foe, each eager to
inflict the <i>coup de grace</i>. But Aguilar is by no
means vanquished yet. Though presently unseated,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_689' href='#Page_689'>689</a></span>
he maintains for some time a desperate struggle,
striking with deadly effect upon the enemy. Then
he loses his sword, and nothing remains to him but
a dagger. It is not in this instance the bravery
of the man that astonishes so much as his extraordinary
muscular power. The horse, by kicking and
plunging, prevents capture, while Aguilar, circumscribed
by threatening death, exhibits almost superhuman
strength. No blow dealt to kill or stun, no
attempt to seize him, can stop the quick stroke of that
strong right arm as it drives the keen steel straight
into the assailants' vitals. With wounds and ever
increasing exertion, however, he grows weaker; but
capture signifies immolation. To be gazed at, helpless
on a heathen altar, an offering to odious gods—the
thought is horrible—and the fatal dagger is
still, by swift movements, driven to the hilt. And
now the battle cry of Santiago to the rescue! rings
in his ears and tells of succor; he hears a leaden
sound, as of crushed bone and flesh, and the whistle
of descending blades, and knows that help is at hand.
Six horsemen have plunged into the unequal contest,
and they scatter the swarthy foe like sheep. They
gather round their countryman, support his exhausted
frame, and carry him wounded and faint to a place of
safety. The courage, strength, and skill of this
single man, and the valor displayed in his rescue,
so impressed the Chignautecs that they retired disheartened,
regarding their efforts of no avail against
such beings,<a id='FA_XXVII-22' href='#FN_XXVII-22' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-22]</a> and they returned to their homes.
</p>

<p>
The siege had now lasted a month. On the third
day after the retrograde movement, which resulted in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_690' href='#Page_690'>690</a></span>
victory, the Spaniards determined to make another
attempt upon the place, and were on the point of
assault when an ambassador arrived from the Chignautecs
tendering their submission, and bringing
the customary presents of gold, green plumes, and
costly mantles. It was, however, stipulated on their
part that this act of allegiance should be kept secret
until the fall of Mixco; at the same time the envoy
intimated that their caciques would communicate
privately to Alvarado a secret that would be of
service to him. Alvarado received this message favorably,
and sent back the emissary with every mark of
consideration, expressing his willingness to hear what
the chiefs had to say.
</p>

<p>
The distance from Mixco to Chignauta was nine
leagues; and in three days, during which Alvarado
had refrained from active operations, the principal
caciques arrived at his camp. They were attended
by a large retinue and a number of natives bearing
presents of great aboriginal value and a large quantity
of provisions. The disclosure made by the caciques
was to the effect that there existed a subterranean
passage from the stronghold, having an outlet in the
woods near the river bank. By this the Mixcans
could escape, they said, even if the Spaniards succeeded
in storming the height. The outlet they were
willing to disclose, as they owed no allegiance to the
Mixcans, who had incited them to take up arms against
the Spaniards. They moreover suggested that an
ambuscade should be placed near the mouth.<a id='FA_XXVII-23' href='#FN_XXVII-23' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-23]</a>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE FALL OF MIXCO.</div>

<p>
A force of forty men, cross-bowmen and cavalry,
commanded by Alonso Lopez de Loarca, was accordingly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_691' href='#Page_691'>691</a></span>
despatched to the exit of the passage,<a id='FA_XXVII-24' href='#FN_XXVII-24' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-24]</a> and
thereupon Alvarado determined once more to attempt
to storm the place. The front man of the storming
line bore a shield, and behind him followed a cross-bowman;
then succeeded another shield-bearer, supported
by an arquebusier. This alternate order afforded
protection and at the same time admitted of assault.<a id='FA_XXVII-25' href='#FN_XXVII-25' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-25]</a>
The file thus formed was led by Bernardino de Arteaga,
who had asked for the dangerous post as a favor,
and succeeded in covering his name with honor.
Calling on God and Santiago, they began the ascent
of the narrow ridge, which widened as it joined the
cliff. While moving as rapidly as possible, so that the
showering stones and arrows might have less effect,
they nevertheless plied cross-bow and arquebuse with
deadly effect. They had almost reached a wider place
in the ridge, where four men might walk abreast,
when the gallant Arteaga was felled with a heavy
stone, breaking his leg, but with indomitable will he
struggled on, supported by his comrade Diego Lopez
de Villanueva.<a id='FA_XXVII-26' href='#FN_XXVII-26' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-26]</a> Despite the terrible resistance they
reached the broader space near the cliff, which was
packed with defenders so eager for a blow at the
assailants that many were crowded off the precipice
by those behind. But the stormers were by this
time enabled to fall partially into line and ply their
blades. A hand-to-hand contest followed, and the
ground soon became thickly strewn with the bodies
of slain Mixcans, among which were heaps of lopped-off
heads and limbs. More Spaniards and auxiliaries
came rapidly forward to aid in the slaughter as
ground could be cleared for them to stand on. The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_692' href='#Page_692'>692</a></span>
natives fought with desperation, but height after
height was lost to them, until their victorious foe
gained at last the plain above. There the Spaniards
found fresh forces to oppose them. But the Mixcans
were by this time overawed by the extraordinary
achievement of the Spaniards; and as they marked
these merciless white foemen, the first who had ever
planted foot within the precincts of their famed and
formidable stronghold, as they saw them moving
onward and upward, invincible as fate, it is no wonder
that their hearts sank with despair. Their opposition
was wholly spiritless; they broke and fled at the first
charge. What followed was frightful, surpassing even
the terrible scenes to which these man-killers on both
sides were accustomed. To escape the fierce onslaught
of the Spaniards some of the Mixcans plunged headlong
down the cliffs, the dull thud of their bodies, as
they struck upon the rocks, sounding ghostly echoes
in the ravine below. Some attempted escape by the
now deserted path by which the assailants had come,
but these were captured by the camp guard. Some
fled by the subterranean caverns, but were pursued
and many taken prisoners before they reached the
outlet, while those who had previously withdrawn
thither with the women and children, under the care
of several caciques, on emerging at the outlet were
assailed by Loarca, and most of them captured.<a id='FA_XXVII-27' href='#FN_XXVII-27' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-27]</a>
</p>

<p>
Thus terminated this remarkable exploit of the
conquerors. The city was burned, the stronghold
destroyed, and the population removed to the site of
the present town of the same name, situated in the
Valle de las Vacas.<a id='FA_XXVII-28' href='#FN_XXVII-28' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-28]</a>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ZACATEPEC WAR.</div>

<p class="p2">
It was not long after the fall of Mixco that the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_693' href='#Page_693'>693</a></span>
conquest of the Zacatepec Valley was accomplished.
The towns of this district were subject to the king
of the Cakchiquels, but many of them, especially
Zacatepec, had thrown off their allegiance and declared
themselves independent, indignant at Sinacam's
alliance with the Spaniards.<a id='FA_XXVII-29' href='#FN_XXVII-29' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-29]</a> They had, moreover,
repeatedly shown their hostility to those towns which
had submitted to Spanish rule, by making incursions
into their lands, and carrying off their women and
children to the sacrifice.<a id='FA_XXVII-30' href='#FN_XXVII-30' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-30]</a>
</p>

<p>
After the suppression of the revolt and the re-establishment
of Spanish power in the Patinamit
district,<a id='FA_XXVII-31' href='#FN_XXVII-31' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-31]</a> the caciques of Xinaco and Zumpango remonstrated
with the Zacatepecs, saying that they
were now under the protection of the children of the
sun, and should appeal to them if the depredations
on their lands did not cease. The unfortunate men
who carried this message were summarily sacrificed
on the altar stone, all save one, whose life was spared
that he might carry back the reply of the Zacatepecs:
"Let the children of the sun bring to life again the
dead envoys. As for ourselves, we will not submit
to an unknown people, but will destroy all the villages
of the caciques before their allies can render
assistance." Nor were they slow to carry out their
threat.
</p>

<p>
A large force invaded the territory of Xinaco and
Zumpango, and began to slay and lay waste. The
natives sent to Guatemala to implore assistance. Alvarado
was at this time absent on his second campaign
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_694' href='#Page_694'>694</a></span>
to Salvador,<a id='FA_XXVII-32' href='#FN_XXVII-32' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-32]</a> carrying out his former intention to return
and bring the stubborn natives to a recognition
of Spaniards' rights. Nevertheless, one thousand
Cakchiquels and ten arquebusiers, under the command
of Antonio de Salazar, a most competent captain,
were at once despatched to the scene of action, while
Alvarado was advised of what had occurred. Hostilities
had already begun before these troops arrived.
For three days the Zacatepecs maintained the conflict
with great bravery, though with considerable
loss. But now the Spaniards received a reinforcement
of ten arquebusiers, twenty horsemen, and two
hundred Tlascaltecs and Mexicans, commanded by
Pedro Gonzalez Nájera. The contest thereafter was
not so evenly balanced, and the Zacatepecs sustained
several defeats. On the fifth day, however, they
adopted the plan of attacking in columns one thousand
strong, successively relieving each other, so that fresh
men continually kept up the battle, each column when
relieved retiring to the rear.<a id='FA_XXVII-33' href='#FN_XXVII-33' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-33]</a> These tactics enabled
them to maintain the fight during the whole of that
day, and they inflicted no little loss on the Spanish
forces. Early in the morning the Spaniards took the
field, apparently in disorder and much reduced in numbers.
Encouraged by the success of their new manœuvres,
the Zacatepecs attacked with contemptuous
confidence. The Spaniards gave way and retreated
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_695' href='#Page_695'>695</a></span>
toward a thickly wooded ravine. The Zacatepecs now
felt sure of victory, and in their impetuous pursuit
allowed themselves to be drawn into the defile, where
a large body of their enemies were lying in ambush.
Suddenly assailed on both sides, their disorderly ranks
were routed with great slaughter. Numbers were
also taken prisoners, among whom were many caciques.
This battle terminated the war. The whole Zacatepec
valley submitted to the authority of the Spaniards;
and in order to insure future obedience a garrison of
ten Spaniards and one hundred and forty Tlascaltecs
was stationed at Zacatepec, under the command of
Diego de Alvarado, the caciques being detained as
hostages.<a id='FA_XXVII-34' href='#FN_XXVII-34' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-34]</a>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">CONQUEST OF THE MAMES.</div>

<p class="p2">
About the middle of the year 1525 Sequechul,
king of Utatlan, represented to Alvarado that his
father Oxib Quieh had not been so guilty as he had
supposed of the treacherous plot to destroy the Spaniards
the year previous, but that Caibil Balam,<a id='FA_XXVII-35' href='#FN_XXVII-35' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-35]</a> king
of the Mames,<a id='FA_XXVII-36' href='#FN_XXVII-36' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-36]</a> was more to blame, as the instigator
of the attempt. At the same time he offered to provide
the invading forces with guides if Alvarado would
undertake the conquest of that kingdom and punish
Caibil Balam. Whether Sequechul's object was revenge
for his father's cruel death or favor with Alvarado
is of little consequence; the mention he made of
the broad lands and great wealth of the province fell
pleasantly on the lieutenant-general's ear, and he willingly
acceded to the king's proposal.
</p>

<p>
The expedition was placed under the command of
Gonzalo de Alvarado, and consisted of eighty Spanish
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_696' href='#Page_696'>696</a></span>
infantry, the captains being Antonio de Salazar and
Francisco de Arévalo, together with forty cavalrymen
and two thousand native auxiliaries, drawn from
various districts, whose commanders were Jorge de
Acuña, Pedro de Aragon, Bernardino de Oviedo, and
Juan de Verastigui. These forces were, moreover,
accompanied by three hundred pioneers, with axes
and picks, while a large number of Indian carriers
bore with them an ample supply of provisions besides
the baggage. Early in July the army marched to
Totonicapan, a town on the confines of the Mame
territory, which was made the base of operations.
The usual difficulties of such undertakings here began.
It took the invaders no less than eight days to cross
the mountain range between that place and the Rio
Hondo. The season rendered their labors the greater,
for the rain, day after day, poured down in torrents.
Up steep ascents, down dangerous gullies, they toiled,
now winding in single file along the edge of a precipice,
now plunging over soft treacherous ground up
to the knee in mud. On reaching the Hondo<a id='FA_XXVII-37' href='#FN_XXVII-37' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-37]</a> they
bivouacked for two days in the dripping sunless woods
on the bank of the river, which, swollen by the ceaseless
rains, for a time defied their passage. At length
they succeeded in crossing, and presently emerged
from the forests upon an open plain, and descried on
an eminence the Mame town of Mazatenango. It was
a well fortified place, surrounded by a barricade of
heavy timber, behind which, on a terre-plein of mud
and straw, a great multitude of warriors were drawn
up. A wide stretch of swampy ground, not differing
in appearance from the rest of the plain, debarred approach
to this side of the town. As the invading
army drew near, the Mames with hisses and shouts
of defiance challenged attack, in the hope of inducing
them to charge into the swamp. Gonzalo de Alvarado
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_697' href='#Page_697'>697</a></span>
was, however, timely advised of the danger by his
guides, and making a detour he assaulted the barricade
on the other side, where the ground was firm.
The assailants were received with a blinding storm
of missiles, which for a long time kept them in check.
Their repeated efforts to burst through the defences
were baffled, and the auxiliaries were becoming discouraged,
when Gomez de Loarca with the cavalry plunged
through the palisade. The besiegers, pouring in
through the breach, could now fight after their own
fashion; and though the Mames offered a brave resistance,
they were routed with great slaughter, and their
town taken possession of by the conquerors, who placed
in it a sufficient garrison as a protection in their rear.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">PRINCE CAN ILOCAB.</div>

<p>
Continuing their march, they encounter at no great
distance from Mazatenango an army of five thousand
warriors from Malacatan, whereupon Gonzalo takes up
a favorable position on the plain.<a id='FA_XXVII-38' href='#FN_XXVII-38' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-38]</a> The vanguard of
the enemy is composed of slingers and archers, and
the main body of spearmen, commanded by the renowned
prince Can Ilocab. In perfect order, and with
deafening sound of drums and conchs, they approach
the Spanish army. As soon as the vanguard has
reached a suitable point Gonzalo charges upon them
with the cavalry. The arrows strike thick as hail
on the mailed breasts of the horsemen, drawing fire
therefrom; but the chargers dash through the ranks
of the archers, who with stubborn courage disdain
to fly, while to avoid the fatal lance thrusts they throw
themselves under the horses, only to be crushed and
mangled by the iron-shod hoofs. And now the main
body of the Mames come up, and the Spanish cavalry
have more difficult work. The charge against those
solid columns bristling with long spears is only partially
successful. The shock is sustained by the
Mames with a firmness the Spaniards are little accustomed
to. The discomfited vanguard has time to rally,
and again the swift stone bruises, and arrows hiss
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_698' href='#Page_698'>698</a></span>
and shiver on helmet and coat of mail. All the forces
on both sides are now in action, and the slaughter
of the Mames is dreadful, yet not one inch will they
yield. Rushing to close quarters, within their opponents'
breastwork of sword-points, and gliding along
their lances, they so hamper the Spaniards that they
can hardly wield their arms. Bruised and stunned,
embarrassed in their movements, the blows of the
Spaniards fall more feebly, and they already begin
to relax their efforts when Salazar, one of the captains
of infantry, seeing the imminent danger, strives
to rouse his men with spirit-stirring words. "Where
is your valor, Castilians?" he cries. "Does that
courage sink which won the blood-stained fields of
Mexico and Utatlan? There you achieved renown;
lose it not here, nor suffer yourselves to be carried
off to die on the altars of these idolaters!" The
appeal has its effect. With renewed efforts the infantry
mow their way through and through the Mame
columns, causing frightful carnage, but the warriors
recede not one foot in flight. For still waves in air
their prince's banner; his plume nods high above them
all, and his voice still cheers them on. As long as
he remains they will fight, knowing no defeat. The
Spanish captain is not blind to this, for under the great
Cortés he has learned that in their leader lies the
strength of the warriors, and he recognizes only too
clearly that Can Ilocab's death is their one chance of
victory. For some time the execution of Gonzalo's
purpose has been delayed, but at length by the surging
ranks he is thrown near to the magic banner, and then
with desperate charge he urges his steed through the
resisting guard up to the Mame chieftain, and plunges
the lance through his body. This ends the battle,
and the Mames, unconquered by sword and lance, on
the fall of their prince flee from the field and are
pursued as far as their town. The chiefs of the place
at once send an embassy to sue for peace, bringing
with them a present of gold ornaments, and offering
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_699' href='#Page_699'>699</a></span>
allegiance, which is accepted. Leaving a garrison in
the town, the Spaniards continue their march in the
direction of Huehuetenango.<a id='FA_XXVII-39' href='#FN_XXVII-39' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-39]</a>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">ZAKULÉU INVESTED.</div>

<p>
This was an important city of the Mames, where
Gonzalo de Alvarado expected warm work, judging
from the late formidable resistance. On arrival, however,
he found the place abandoned, and such of the
houses as had not been destroyed stripped of furniture
and utensils, without a handful of provisions.
Cavalry troops were sent out in different directions,
and one under the command of Gaspar Aleman fell in
with three hundred Indian archers, who without hesitation
attacked the horsemen, among others wounding
Aleman in the face. But they were soon routed, and
in the pursuit three prisoners were taken, one of
whom was a chief named Sahquiab, a captain in Caibil
Balam's army. When brought into the presence of
Gonzalo de Alvarado, he informed him that his sovereign
had retired to the almost impregnable city of
Zakuléu,<a id='FA_XXVII-40' href='#FN_XXVII-40' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-40]</a> where, provided with provisions and stores,
he deemed himself secure. The captive was thereupon
sent by Gonzalo to Caibil Balam with offers of peace
and a charitable proposal to teach him the doctrines
of the Christian religion. But Sahquiab did not
return, nor came any answer to Gonzalo. A second
embassy, composed of Indians from Utatlan, was
rudely refused audience with a shower of arrows. This
exhausted the patience of Gonzalo and he marched on
Zakuléu. As soon as his approach was observed by
the Mames an army six thousand strong sallied forth
to give him battle. The engagement which followed
was maintained by the Mames with the same stubborn
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_700' href='#Page_700'>700</a></span>
valor exhibited in previous fights, and marked by
similar carnage. A reserve of two thousand, which
sallied during the battle from Zakuléu to the support
of their countrymen, made an ineffectual attempt to
turn the tide of victory, only adding to the victims;
and routed in all directions the Mames fled to their
stronghold in the mountains.<a id='FA_XXVII-41' href='#FN_XXVII-41' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-41]</a>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">PREPARING TO STORM ZAKULÉU.</div>

<p>
Owing to the impossibility of storming so impregnable
a place as Zakuléu, Gonzalo closely invested it
by stationing troops at the few points where egress
seemed possible. On the third day of the siege Diego
Lopez de Villanueva, while reconnoitring with a body
of cavalry, observed smoke issuing from the woods on
the other side of the river.<a id='FA_XXVII-42' href='#FN_XXVII-42' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-42]</a> Having crossed with
much difficulty, he fell in with three hundred Indians
in charge of a large supply of provisions, which they
intended to introduce into the beleaguered city, and
which Villanueva promptly appropriated.
</p>

<p>
The inactive warfare soon wore out the patience
of the Spaniards, and Gonzalo began to cut a road
suitable for cavalry up the most practicable part of
the steep. Day by day, from morning to night, the
sound of the pick was heard, and the work continued
uninterrupted with but little loss to the besiegers,
though the heights were thronged with Mames, who
used every effort to impede its progress. The cross-bow
and arquebuse were far more deadly than the
sling and arm-drawn bow, and the Mames suffered
heavily.
</p>

<p>
In the midst of these operations an army of eight
thousand mountaineers appeared on the plain, presenting
a most unusual spectacle—naked, and hideous
with war-paint, unrelieved by plume or ornament of
any kind, only by the glitter of their weapons. The
Spanish captain immediately made preparation for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_701' href='#Page_701'>701</a></span>
battle. Leaving a sufficient number to protect the
work and guard the camp,<a id='FA_XXVII-43' href='#FN_XXVII-43' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-43]</a> he advanced against them
with the remainder of his forces, and was soon engaged
in a desperate struggle. Three several times the
ranks of the mountaineers were broken, and as often
did they rally and attack with ever increasing fury.
Only the steel and cotton armor of the Spanish forces
saved them from destruction. As it was, lance and
sword, bullet and bolt, reaped the usual harvest, and
on the plain, saturated with blood and bespotted
with mangled bodies, the Spaniards at last stood triumphant.<a id='FA_XXVII-44' href='#FN_XXVII-44' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-44]</a>
</p>

<p>
Thenceforth the siege continued uninterrupted.
The work of cutting the road dragged slowly on,
and by the middle of October both besiegers and
besieged were undergoing intense suffering. Within
the city famine was daily gathering its victims; every
eatable substance, to the leather of their shields,
had been consumed, and the survivors were feeding
on the bodies of the dead. Scarcity of provisions,
too, was felt in the Spanish camp. But this was not
the worst. The weather was unusually severe; icy
hailstorms and keen frosts caused much suffering to
the invaders, unaccustomed to the cold of that altitude.
Fever and ague also attacked them. From
the rain and hail that fell the plain had become a
swamp, and day by day Gonzalo saw the number of
his haggard troops' grow smaller. A more speedy
method of reducing the place must be adopted or the
attempt abandoned. Accordingly he sent off his sick
to Huehuetenango, and stopping work on the road,
prepared to make the desperate attempt to storm
the place with scaling ladders.<a id='FA_XXVII-45' href='#FN_XXVII-45' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-45]</a> He had already constructed
a number of these ladders, huge in size and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_702' href='#Page_702'>702</a></span>
wide enough to allow three men to ascend abreast,
and was on the point of making the attack when there
appeared an envoy from Caibil Balam suing for peace.
This unfortunate ruler had previously attempted to
escape by night with his family and an escort of the
principal chiefs; but having fallen in with a patrolling
party, he was wounded in the arm with a cross-bow
bolt and compelled to return. And now he had taken
counsel with his chiefs on the subject of surrender.
He had represented to them that all hope of relief
was gone, while his famished subjects were dying
around him. Submission alone could save the few
survivors. The chiefs had eagerly approved his
words, and the tender of submission was made.
Gonzalo's satisfaction at this unexpected termination
of the siege was indeed great. A spot midway
between the gate of Zakuléu and the quarters of the
cavalry was appointed as the place of meeting for the
settlement of terms, and Gonzalo, accompanied by
Loarca, Salazar, Arévalo, and twelve others, there
met the humbled Caibil Balam. The Spaniard's reception
of the native ruler was friendly in the extreme,
and with an embrace, Gonzalo assured him of his love
and friendship. Under such kindly treatment, so little
expected, the stoical self-command of the weakened
warrior gave way, and he wept as he returned the
victor's greeting.

The Spaniards then took formal possession of the
city in the name of the king of Spain.<a id='FA_XXVII-46' href='#FN_XXVII-46' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-46]</a> They destroyed
the fortification at the entrance,<a id='FA_XXVII-47' href='#FN_XXVII-47' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-47]</a> and made
more practicable the road across the ravine. The
surrounding country was afterward explored and the
towns subjected to Spanish rule. In Huehuetenango
Gonzalo de Alvarado stationed a strong garrison, with
Gonzalo de Solis as captain, and having taken all the
necessary measures for the permanent tranquillity of

his newly conquered territory, he returned to Guatemala
City toward the end of the year.

<p>
Henceforth conquest, oppression, and destruction
marched hand-in-hand over the country, and the result
was a national and social eclipse of the fallen
races. Their arts and sciences were soon forgotten;
their architectural skill was lost; and from a state of
happy development their life as a nation was blotted
out. To what extent the progress of the world would
have been benefited or retarded, had the aboriginal
inhabitants of the American table-lands survived as
integral nations, it is impossible to say; but we may
question how much the occupation of the country by
the Spaniards contributed toward general advancement.
It is thought by some that the great Indian
nations had reached the limit of their present line of
progress when the Spaniards arrived. In Guatemala
the individual kings had by long lines of succession
arrived at that stage of monarchy when power begets
luxury and decay. Without European interference
there might have been a relapse and a dark age; and
a later view, had discovery been delayed to our own
time for instance, might have found Mexico and Central
America overrun by savage hordes from the north
and ruined cities scattered over the land. To this
fancy I am not prepared wholly to subscribe.<a id='FA_XXVII-48' href='#FN_XXVII-48' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-48]</a>

<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_III-1'>[III-1]</a></span> The island known to-day as Hayti was named by Columbus <i>Insula Hispaniæ</i>,
Island of Spain. On one of his maps it is called <i>Insula Hyspaniæ</i>,
and on another <i>Hyspana</i>. By the early navigators and chroniclers the name
was turned into Spanish and spoken and written <i>La Isla Española</i>, the
Spanish Isle, or <i>La Española</i>. <i>Hispaniola</i>, as it is called at a later period
by English authors, is neither Latin nor Spanish; it may be a syncope of the
words <i>Insula Hyspaniæ</i>, or more likely it is a corruption of <i>La Española</i> by
foreigners to whom the Spanish <i>ñ</i> was not familiar. The choice lies between
the mutilation, <i>Hispaniola</i>, of English authors, and the correct but unfamiliar
<i>Española</i>, and I adopt the latter.

<p class='footnote' id='FN_III-2'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_III-2'>[III-2]</a></span> Usually two royal officers went out by each departure; a treasurer to
take charge of the gold, and a notary to watch the treasurer and write
down what was seen and done. The government was exceedingly strict in
its regulations of discoveries by sea, as well as in all matters relative to commerce
and colonization. Notice was given by Ferdinand and Isabella September
3, 1501, by Charles V. November 17, 1526, and by Philip II. in 1563,
that no one should go to the Indies except under express license from the
king. In 1526 Charles V. ordered that the captain of any discovering or
trading vessel should not go ashore within the limits mentioned in his patent
without the permission of the royal officers and priests on board, under
penalty of confiscation of half the goods. The law of 1556 stipulates that
ships must be properly equipped, provisioned for one year, always sail
in pairs, and carry in each two pilots and two priests. In his <i>ordenanzas
de poblaciones</i> of 1563 Philip II. directs that vessels making discoveries
shall carry scissors, combs, knives, looking-glasses, rifles, axes, fishhooks,
colored caps, glass beads, and the like, as means of introduction and
traffic. <i>Recopilacion de Leyes de los Reynos de las Indias</i>, ii. 6-7. In regard
to the share of the crown in the gold gathered our popular writers seem to
have found original authorities somewhat vague. It is clearly enough stated
that settlers are to pay two thirds; the question is whether in relation to
discoverers gold is included in products of which one tenth was to go to
the crown, or whether the exception to a rule was unintentionally omitted.
Mr Irving glides gracefully over the difficulty with the same degree of indefiniteness
that he finds in the authorities. Mr Prescott states positively,
<i>History of Ferdinand and Isabella</i>, ii. 488, that 'the ships fitted out under
the general license were required to reserve ... two thirds of all the gold'
for the crown, quoting Muñoz and Navarrete as vouchers, the words of neither
justifying the statement. Muñoz, <i>Hist. Nuevo Mundo</i>, i. 240, says, 'se
concedió á todos generalmente, sin mas gravamen que pagar la décima
de lo que se rescatase,' while Navarrete, <i>Col. de Viages</i>, ii. 167, printing
the <i>real provision</i> itself, states simply 'es nuestra merced que de lo que
las dichas personas hallaren en las dichas islas é tierra-firme hayan para
sí las nueve partes, é la otra diezma parte sea para Nos.' The misstatement
of the talented author of <i>Ferdinand and Isabella</i> is rendered all the more
conspicuous when on the very next page quoted by him Muñoz settles the
whole matter exactly contrary to Prescott's account. 'todos se permitió
llevar víveres y mercancías, rescatar oro de los naturales contribuyendo al rey
con la décima.' And after thus stating distinctly that all might trade with
the natives for gold on paying one tenth to the crown, he gives the reason
why miners must pay two thirds to the crown; or if the recipient of pecuniary
aid from the crown, then four fifths; it was because of the supposed exceeding
richness of the mines, the ease with which gold could be obtained; and,
further, the dependence of the crown on its mines, more than on anything else
for a colonial revenue. Prior to 1504 the regulation of the royal share was
not fixed, some of the traders paying one tenth gross, some one fifth gross,
and some one fourth net. Bobadilla, in 1500, granted twenty years' licenses
to settlers in Española to work gold mines by paying only one eleventh to
the crown. Summarizing the subsequent laws upon the subject, we find
ordered by Ferdinand and Isabella, February 5, 1504, reiterated by Philip,
1572, that all dwellers in the Indies must pay to the crown one fifth of all
gold, silver, lead, tin, quicksilver, iron, or other metal obtained by them;
likewise traders were to pay one fifth of all gold, silver, or other metals,
pearls, precious stones, or amber obtained by them. September 14, 1519,
Charles V. declared that of all gold received in trade from the natives one fifth
must be paid to him; and March 8, 1530, he said that where a reward has been
promised to a prospector of mines the royal treasury would pay two thirds
of that reward, and the private persons interested one third. It was ordered
September 4, 1536, and reiterated June 19, 1540, that all persons must pay
the king's fifth on the before-mentioned articles, whether obtained in battle
or by plundering-expeditions, or by trade. Of all gold, silver, pearls, and
precious stones received as ransom of a cacique or other principal personage
the king was to have one third; the remainder, after deducting the king's
fifth, was to be divided among the members of the expedition. Of the spoils
secured from a cacique slain in battle, or executed, one half was the crown's,
and one half, except the king's fifth, the property of the conquerors. June
5, 1551, it was ordered, and reiterated August 24, 1619, that beside the king's
share, there be levied a duty of 1½ per cent. to pay for smelting, assaying,
and stamping. By the <i>ordenanzas de poblaciones</i> of Philip II., 1563, the
adelantado of a discovery by land, and his successor, and the settlers were to
pay the crown but one tenth on metals and precious stones for the term of
ten years. <i>Recop. de Indias</i>, ii. 10, 68, 75-7, 79, and 480-1.

<p>It is often remarked with wonder
in what small and apparently insecure
vessels the early navigators
traversed perilous seas and explored
unknown coasts. That shipwreck so
often attended their ventures is less
surprising than that so many escaped
destruction. Two of the three vessels
employed by Columbus were
open boats, according to <i>March y
Labores</i>, <i>Historia de la Marina Real
Española</i>, i. 98, of forty tons each,
and the decked <i>Santa María</i>, only
sixty tons. The term caravel was originally given to ships navigated wholly by
sails as distinguished from the galley propelled by oars. It has been applied
to a great variety of vessels of different size and construction. The caravels of
the New World discoverers may be generally described as long, narrow boats of
from twenty to one hundred tons burden, with three or four masts of about equal
height carrying sometimes square and sometimes lateen sails, the fourth mast
set at the heel of the bowsprit carrying square sails. They were usually half-decked,
and adorned with the lofty forecastle and loftier poop of the day. The
latter constituted over that part of the vessel a double or treble deck, which was
pierced for cannon. A class of vessels like the <i>Santa María</i>, beside a double
stern deck, had a forward deck armed with small pieces for throwing stones and
grape. In the archives of Mallorca is a picture of a caravel drawn in 1397,
and a very fair representation of those in use a century later may be found on
Juan de la Cosa's map. The large decked ships of from 100 to 1200 tons had
two, three, or four masts, and square sails, with high poop and sometimes
high prow. In naval engagements and in discovery the smaller vessels seemed
to be preferred, being more easily handled. Columbus, at Paria, complained
of his vessel of 100 tons as being too large. In his <i>ordenanzas de poblaciones</i>
of 1563 Philip II. required every discoverer to take at least two vessels of
not over sixty tons each, in order to enter inlets, cross the bars of rivers, and
pass over shoals. The larger ships, if any were of the expedition, must
remain in a safe port until another safe port was found by the small craft.
Thirty men and no more were to go in every ship, and the pilots must write
down what they encountered for the benefit of other pilots. <i>Recop. de Indias</i>,
ii. 5-6. The <i>galera</i> was a vessel of low bulwarks, navigated by sails and
oars, usually twenty or thirty oars on either side, four or five oarsmen to
a bench. It frequently carried a large cannon, called <i>cruxia</i>, two of medium
size, and two small guns. The <i>galeaza</i> was the largest class of galera, or
craft propelled wholly or in part by oars. It had three masts; it commonly
carried twenty cannon, and the poop accommodated a small army of fusileers
and sharpshooters. A <i>galeota</i> was
a small galera, having only sixteen
or twenty oarsmen on a side, and
two masts. The <i>galeon</i> was a large
armed merchant vessel with high
bulwarks, three or four decks, with
two or three masts, square-rigged
spreading courses and top-sails, and
sometimes top-gallant sails. One
fleet of twelve galleons, from 1000 to
1200 tons burden, was named after
the twelve apostles. Those which
plied between Acapulco and Manila
were from 1200 to 2000 tons burden.
A <i>galeoncillo</i> was a small galeon.
The <i>carac</i> was a large carrying vessel,
the one intended for Columbus'
second voyage being 1250 <i>toneles</i>, or
1500 tons. A <i>nao</i>, or <i>navío</i>, was a large ship with high bulwarks and three
masts. A <i>nave</i> was a vessel with deck and sails; the former distinguishing
it from the <i>barca</i>, and the absence of oars from a galera. The <i>bergantin</i>, or
brig, had low bulwarks; the <i>bergantin-goleta</i> was a hermaphrodite brig, or
brigantine, built for fast sailing. The name brigantine was applied in America
also to an open flat-bottomed boat which usually carried one sail and from
eight to sixteen men, with a capacity for about 100 persons.

<p class='footnote' id='FN_III-5'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_III-5'>[III-5]</a></span> The Spanish league varies with time and place. It was not until 1801
that the diverse measurements of the several original kingdoms were by royal
order made uniform, the legal league then becoming throughout all Spain
20,000 Spanish feet. Of these leagues there are twenty to the degree,
making each three geographical miles, being, as specified by the law, the distance
travelled on foot at a steady gait in one hour. The land league was,
by law of Alfonso the Wise, 3000 paces, as specified by the <i>Siete Partidas</i>.
The discoverers roughly estimated a league at from two and a half to three
and a half English miles. A marine or geographical league at that time was
about 7500 varas, or little less than four English miles, there being nearly 17½
to a degree of latitude. In different parts of Spanish America the league
is different, being sometimes quite short. In Cuba a league consists of
5078 varas, and in Mexico of 5000 varas. The vara is the Spanish yard,
comprising three Spanish feet of eleven English inches each. Since the
decline of Roman influence, the Spaniards have had no equivalent for the
English mile.

another tropical marine worm, the <i>Simnoria terebrans</i>, brought hither by ships,
play havoc with the wharf-piling of San Francisco and other west-coast
harbors.
</p>

<p class='footnote' id='FN_III-8'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_III-8'>[III-8]</a></span> The early chroniclers make their reckonings of values under different
names at different times. Thus during the discoveries of Columbus we hear
of little else but <i>maravedís</i>; then the <i>peso de oro</i> takes the lead, together
with the <i>castellano</i>; all along <i>marco</i> and <i>ducado</i> being occasionally used. At
the beginning of the sixteenth century, and before and after, Spanish values
were reckoned from a mark of silver, which was the standard. A mark was
half a pound either of gold or silver. The gold mark was divided into fifty
castellanos; the silver mark into eight ounces. In the reign of Ferdinand
and Isabella the mark was divided by law into 65 <i>reales de vellon</i> of 34 maravedís
each, making 2210 maravedís in a mark. To show how changeable
were the values of subsidiary Spanish coins, and how utterly impossible it is
accurately and at all times to determine by their names the amount of metal
they represent, it is only necessary to state that in the reign of Alfonso XI.,
1312-1350, there were 125 maravedís to the mark, while in the reign of Ferdinand
VII., 1808-1833, a mark was divided into 5440 maravedís. In Spanish
America a <i>real</i> is one eighth of a <i>peso</i>, and equal to 2½ reales de vellon. The
peso contains one ounce of silver; it was formerly called <i>peso de ocho reales de
plata</i>, whence came the term <i>pieces of eight</i>, a vulgarism at one time in vogue
among the merchants and buccaneers in the West Indies. This coin is designated
more particularly as <i>peso fuerte</i>, or <i>peso duro</i>, to distinguish it from
<i>peso sencillo</i>, equivalent in value to four fifths of the former. The mutilator
of Herrera translates <i>pesos de oro</i> as pieces of eight, in which as in other
things he is about as far as possible wrong. The castellano, the one fiftieth
of the golden mark, in the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella, was equivalent
to 490 maravedís of that day. The <i>peso de oro</i>, according to Oviedo, was
exactly equivalent to the castellano, and either was one third greater than
the ducado, or ducat. The <i>doblon</i>, the popular name for the <i>excelente</i>, was
first struck by Ferdinand and Isabella as a gold coin of the weight of
two castellanos. The modern doubloon is an ounce of coined gold, and
is worth 16 pesos fuertes. Reduced to United States currency the peso
fuerte, as slightly alloyed bullion, is in weight nearly enough equivalent to
one dollar. Therefore a mark of silver is equal to eight dollars; a piece of
eight, equal to one peso, which equals one dollar; a real de vellon, five cents;
a Spanish-American real, 12½ cents; a maravedí, 100/276 of a cent; a castellano, or
peso de oro, $2.56; a doubloon, $5.14; a ducat, $1.92; a mark of gold, $128,
assuming the United States alloy. The fact that a castellano was equivalent
to only 490 maravedís shows the exceedingly high value of silver as compared
with gold at the period in question. The modern ounce, or doubloon, is valued
at about $16. As to the relative purchasing power of the precious metals
at different times during the past four centuries economists differ. The
returns brought by the first discoverers began the depreciation, which was
rapidly accelerated by the successive conquests, notably of Mexico and Peru.
Any one may estimate; no one can determine with exactness. Robertson,
Prescott, and other writers make but guess-work of it (see <i>Hist. America</i>,
and <i>Conq. Mexico</i>, passim) when they attempt to measure the uncertain
and widely diversified denominations of centuries ago by the current coin of
to-day.

<p class='footnote' id='FN_III-9'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_III-9'>[III-9]</a></span> Las Casas, who was at Santo Domingo when the shipwrecked mariners
arrived, saw Bastidas, and part of his gold, and the natives of Darien whom
he had brought, and who in place of the Adamic fig-leaf wore a funnel-shaped
covering of gold. There were great riches, it was said; three chests
full of gold and pearls, which on reaching Spain were ordered to be publicly
displayed in all the towns through which the notary passed on his way to
court. This, as an advertisement of the Indies, was done to kindle the fires
of avarice and discontent in sluggish breasts, that therefrom others might be
induced to go and gather gold and pay the king his fifth. Afterward Bastidas
returned with his wife and children to Santo Domingo, and became rich
in horned cattle, having at one time 8000 head; and that when a cow in
Española was worth 50 pesos de oro. In 1504 he again visited Urabá, in two
ships, and brought thence 600 natives, whom he enslaved in Española. In
1520 the emperor gave him the pacification of Trinidad with the title of adelantado;
which grant being opposed by Diego Colon, on the ground that the
island was of his father's discovering, Bastidas waived his claim, and accepted
the governorship of Santa Marta, where he went with 450 men, and was
assassinated by his lieutenant, Villafuerte, who thought to succeed him, and to
silence the governor's interposed objections to the maltreatment of the natives.
Thus if the humane Bastidas, in accordance with the custom of the day, did
inhumanly enslave his fellow-creatures, he gave his life at last to save them
from other cruelties; which act, standing as it does luminous and alone in a
century of continuous outrage, entitles him to the honorable distinction of
Spain's best and noblest <i>conquistador</i>. As the eloquent Quintana says: 'Bastidas
no se hizo célebre ni como descubridor ni como conquistador; pero su
memoria debe ser grata á todos los amantes de la justicia y de la humanidad,
por haber sido uno de los pocos que trataron á los indios con equidad y mansedumbre,
considerando aquel pais mas bien como un objeto de especulaciones
mercantiles con iguales, que como campo de gloria y de conquistas.'</p>

<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_IV-2'>[IV-2]</a></span> Ferdinand Columbus, or as he is more commonly called Fernando Colon,
was an illegitimate son of Christopher Columbus, by a lady of respectable
family. He was born at Córdova, and in 1494, after his father became
famous, was brought with his elder brother to court, where he was placed as
page to Prince Juan. Upon the death of the heir apparent young Fernando
served Queen Isabella in the same capacity, thereby securing an excellent
education. During this perilous voyage he was an object no less of comfort
than of anxiety to his father, now infirm and troubled in spirit, and his conduct
throughout merited and received paternal commendation. 'El ha salido
y sale de muy buen saber,' writes the fond father, 'bien que él sea niño en
dias, no es assi en el entendimiento.' <i>Cartas de Colon</i>, in <i>Navarrete</i>, <i>Col. de Viages</i>,
i. 341 and 344. See also <i>Zúñiga</i>, <i>Anales de Sevilla</i>. His manhood fulfilled
the promise of his youth. He cultivated literature with considerable success,
and became, as Muñoz, <i>Hist. Nuevo Mundo</i>, i. viii., expresses it, 'doctísimo
para su siglo, y de grandes pensamientos en materias literarias, segun demostraré
á su tiempo.' He travelled extensively in Europe, in the train of
Charles V., probably visited Africa and Asia, and is said to have made two
voyages to America after his father's death. He formed a collection of over
20,000 printed books and manuscripts, which went to the cathedral of Seville.
He neither married, nor left any recognized progeny. He was the author of
several works which have not been preserved, the inscription on his tomb
mentioning one in four divisions relating partly to the New World and his
father's voyages. Antonio de Leon Pinelo, <i>Epitome</i>, 565, 633 and 711, speaks
of a work, <i>Apuntamientos sobre la Demarcacion del Maluco</i>, preserved in
manuscript at Simancas. The only printed book of Fernando Colon is a
history of the admiral, his father. The original title is not known, the manuscript
disappearing before its publication in Spanish. Luis Colon, duke of
Veraguas, and grandson of the admiral, brought the manuscript to Genoa
about 1568, and delivered it to one Fornari, an old man who, according to
Barcia, began to print it in Spanish, Italian, and Latin. Others assert that it
passed into the hands of Marini, who caused it to be translated into Italian by
Alfonso de Ulloa. <i>Spotorno</i>, <i>Codice Diplomatico</i>, 1823, lxiii. Ulloa's translation,
badly made from a bad copy—'sans doute d'après un texte assez fautif,'
<i>Humboldt</i>, <i>Exam. Crit.</i>, i. 13,—was printed in Venice, in 1571, under the
title, <i>Historie del Fernando Colombo; Nelle quali s'ha particolare, &amp; vera relatione
della vita, &amp; de' fatti dell' Ammiraglio D. Christoforo Colombo, suo padre</i>, etc. It
was reprinted in Italian some six or eight times. A French translation
was published in 1680-1, and an English translation has gone the rounds,
appearing in <i>Churchill's Col. Voy.</i>, ii. 480-604;
<i>Kerr's Col. Voy.</i>, iii. 1-242;
and <i>Pinkerton's Col. Voy.</i>, xii. 1-155. It was carelessly retranslated from
the Italian into Spanish by Andrés Gonzalez de Barcia, and printed in his
<i>Historiadores Primitivos de las Indias Occidentales</i>, 3 vols., Madrid, 1749, comprising
pp. 1-128, tom. i., of that series, and entitled, <i>La Historia de D. Fernando
Colon, en la qual se da Particular, y verdadera relacion de la vida, y
hechos de el Almirante D. Christoval Colon, su Padre</i>, etc. This is the edition
most commonly used, and to this I refer, although I have before me
an Italian copy of the edition of 1709. Fernando Colon had peculiar advantages
for writing his father's history. Himself an actor in the events
described, he was moreover personally acquainted with his father's friends,
and held possession of his father's papers. All agree that he made good use
of his opportunity, and that he has given a clear statement of events which
even in his own time began to be distorted. If he was silent touching his
father's family, country, and birth, we must remember that poverty and
obscurity were a disgrace in those days, and that the son Fernando was a
Spaniard. Those who should best know the merits of this author pay him
the highest tribute. Of his work says Muñoz, <i>Hist. Nuevo Mundo</i>, i. viii.,
'Confieso deberle mucho;' and the author Navarrete, <i>Col. de Viages</i>, i. lxx.,
remarks, 'habló siempre con verdad y exactitud, salvo alguna equivocacion
fácil de discernir en buena crítica ... y por tanto pueden aun estas leves
faltas ser efecto de la incuria ó poca inteligencia de ambos traductores.' Attempts
have been made to deny to Fernando the authorship, but this, if
correct, does not materially affect its value, since it is allowed to have been
written from his documents and under his supervision. The vicissitudes to
which the work has been subjected and the mutilation it has suffered afford
grounds for caution not to be disregarded by the historian. Still, the general
tenor and details of the narrative, and the literary bent of the reputed author,
present in themselves sufficient evidence of its authenticity.</p>

<p class="footnote">
With regard to the use of certain proper names encountered thus far in
this history I would say a word. The question presents difficulties in whatsoever
aspect viewed. There are Spanish names of places and persons which
custom has so anglicized as to give to their use in the original the appearance
of affectation—instance Castilla, for Castile; Sevilla, Seville; Fernando
and Isabel, Ferdinand and Isabella; Cárlos V., Charles V.; Felipe II., Philip
II. On the other hand, in writing in English of Spanish affairs, the attempt
to continue indefinitely the anglicizing of Spanish names would be as impossible
as absurd. The two chief objects with me have been to adopt the
best forms, and to preserve consistency; I do not claim eminent success in
either attempt. The result, however, has been the adoption of the following
method, if it may be called a method: The prominent places and persons
of Spain, whose names are invariably given in their anglicized form in current
English literature, I write in the same way; but those same names, as well
as all others, appearing in the New World, where no prominent English
writers have made them familiar in an English form, I present in the original
as written by the best Spanish scholars. Thus the name of the great Genoese
I give in its common latinized form, Christopher Columbus, while in the use
of those of his less eminent brothers and sons, who soon became almost or
altogether Spaniards, I adopt the forms employed by Spaniards.

<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_IV-4'>[IV-4]</a></span> Guanaja is the most easterly of a group called the Bay Islands. To the
west of Guanaja, in the order here named, lie Barbaretta, Helena, Morat,
Ruatan, the largest, and Utila. On Peter Martyr's map, <i>India beyond the
Ganges</i>, 1510, Guanaja is written <i>guanasa</i>. On map iv., <i>Munich Atlas</i>, supposed
to have been drawn by Salvat Pilestrina in 1515, Guanaja is called <i>sam
fir.<sup>co</sup></i>, San Francisco; Ruatan, <i>todo samto</i>; and Utila, <i>I:lhana</i>. Fernando
Colon locates on his map, 1527, <i>y:llana</i>, <i>s:francisco</i>, and <i>todos sanctos</i>, and between
the last two, <i>sancta ffe.</i> On the map of Diego de Ribera, 1529, are
<i>s:fran<sup>co</sup></i>, <i>to stõs</i>, <i>l<sup>a</sup> llana</i>, and <i>s∴ fe.</i> Vaz Dourado, 1571, map x., <i>Munich
Atlas</i>, calls Guanaja, <i>lla ganaxa</i>; Ruatan, <i>aguba</i>; and Utila, <i>dotila</i>. <i>Mercator's
Atlas</i>, 1574, gives <i>Guanaxos</i>;
<i>Ogilby's Map</i>, 1671, <i>Guanaja</i>, <i>Guajama</i>,
<i>Roatan</i>, and <i>Vtila</i>;
<i>Laet</i>, <i>Novvs Orbis</i>, 1633, the same;
<i>Jefferys' Voyages</i>, 1776,
<i>Guanaja</i> or <i>Bonaka</i>, <i>Guajama</i> or <i>Rattan</i>, and <i>Utila</i>. Of Guanaja, Diego de
Porras in <i>Navarrete</i>, <i>Col. de Viages</i>, i. 283, remarks:—'es pequeña, bojará
veinte leguas, no tiene cosa de provecho.' Utila is low and level; hence the
name, L<sup>a</sup> Llana. In his remarks on the two oldest maps of America, Kohl
says of Guanaja:—'Das Columbus sie schon gesehen hat, ist zu bezweifeln,
da er wohl nicht so weit westwärts segelte oder blickte. Vielleicht sahen sie
jedoch Pinzon und Solis 1508. Gewiss ist es, dass sie schon 1516 von einer
spanischen Expedition, die zum Menschenraub von Cuba nach Süden ausgelaufen
war, besucht wurde.' Fernando Colon complains that Solis and Pinzon,
visiting these regions in 1508, re-named many localities, claiming to be the first
discoverers, and thus causing much confusion in the charts of the times.</p>

<p class="footnote">
And here as well as elsewhere I may speak of a work from which I
have derived no inconsiderable advantage in tracing the metamorphoses of
names from those originally given to those finally established. Believing
that much curious and valuable historical information might be obtained by
instituting a close comparison of the nomenclature employed by the earlier
makers of charts at their respective dates, in 1873 I directed Mr Goldschmidt
to bring out and arrange for convenient reference all such relevant
maps as my library contained. Beginning then with the earliest, we entered
on paper prepared for the purpose the names of all the principal places contained
within our territory. And so with the next, and the next, through
the successive periods of discovery, following the coast on one side from Darien
to Texas, and on the other from Panamá to Alaska, and along the Arctic
seaboard to the Mackenzie River. Inland names were included, but their
number was small as compared with those along the ocean. Some 200 maps,
each original authority for its time and place, were thus examined, and the
names which had been applied at various times and by various persons to the
several important geographical points along this vast shore line, and throughout
the inland area, were brought together so that comparisons might be
made, and the nomenclatural history of the several places be quickly and
correctly traced. All of the authorities I cannot mention here, but they will
severally be referred to in their proper places during the course of this history.
The result of this labor at the end of six months, Mr Goldschmidt
working alone after the first fortnight, was three folio manuscript volumes,
entitled <i>Cartography of the Pacific Coast of North America, and of the Eastern
Coasts of Mexico and Central America</i>. The maps more particularly examined
in writing this volume are as follows. Passing the sea charts of
Nicolo and Antonio Zeno, made about 1390, and used by Frobisher; the
ocean and islands between western Europe and eastern Asia from the globe
of Martin Behaim, 1492; the chart of Juan de la Cosa, 1500, showing the
West India Islands, but omitting the coast of Central America; and the map
of Johann Ruysch, 1508,—we have, in part most important, the following:
Map of <i>India beyond the Ganges</i>, drawn by Peter Martyr in 1511, and showing
a coast line from Brazil to the middle of Yucatan. Along this line, in
the order here given, from east to west, are <i>vraba</i>, <i>tariene</i>, <i>el mamol</i>, <i>beragua</i>,
<i>c gra de dios</i>, <i>guanasa</i>, <i>b de lagartos</i>. North of Cuba is a section of
the continental shore line lettered <i>isla de beimini, parte</i>. In Ptolemy's Cosmography,
1513, the coast between Brazil and Florida is given, but without
names. The Atlantic is called <i>Oceanus Occidentalis</i>; and South America,
<i>Terra Incognita</i>. By Reisch, in <i>Margaritha Philosophica</i>, 1515, the map is
called <i>Typvs Vniversalis Terre Ivxta</i>. Two only of the islands are given and
both called <i>Isabella</i>. South of <i>Oceanus Occidentalis</i> is a large continent called
<i>Paria sev Prisilia</i>, Paria or Brazil. There are no names on the line of Central
America, and the only lettering on the small portion of the northern
continent are the mysterious words <i>Zoana Mela</i>, which have given rise to
much discussion. In 1859 was published at Munich, by the Royal Bavarian
Academy of Sciences, from manuscripts in the university library and army
archives, under the auspices of Friedrich Kunstmann, Karl von Spruner, and
Georg M. Thomas, and as supplementary to the text of Kunstmann's <i>Die
Entdeckung Amerikas</i>, a collection of fac-similes of thirteen early maps of
America, entitled <i>Atlas zur Entdeckungsgeschichte Amerikas</i>. This work I
shall cite briefly as the <i>Munich Atlas</i>. Parts of the Pacific States are
shown on maps numbers iv. v. vi. vii. viii. ix. x. xii. and xiii., which will
be further mentioned in their several places. Map iv. was drawn by Salvat
de Pilestrina probably in 1515. It shows none of the main-land above
Yucatan, which is a peninsula. The northern coast of Central America is
given, and the southern seaboard only of the Isthmus. No names are
written on the southern coast. The South Sea is called <i>Mar Visto pelos
castelhanos</i>, Sea seen by the Spaniards. Map v. is supposed to be by Visconte
de Maiollo, 1519. It shows the northern coast of the continent only
from Cape Camaron to about 30° south latitude. In a book entitled <i>Apiano,
Cosmographia</i>, 1575, a copy of a map supposed to have been drawn by
Peter Apianus in 1520, and the first upon which I have seen the name 'America.'
The northern part is long and narrow, of a horseshoe shape, and lettered
<i>Baccalearum</i>. A large continent is placed north of a strait running round
the northern end of North America. Evidently Master Apianus was determined
no one during his time should out-north him in map-delineation of a
region of which absolutely nothing was known, either then or for a long time
after. On a map of North America from the globe of Johann Schöner, 1520,
the name 'America' likewise appears, the lettering on the globe being placed
in Brazil, and being in these words:—<i>America Vel Brasilia Sive Papagalli
Terra</i>. The northern and southern continents are separated by a strait
at the Isthmus. It is to be regretted that Master Schöner had not the
making of the world, so that it should agree with his map, and save canal-cutting.
The western line of the northern continent runs north and south;
the western line of the southern continent north-west and south-east. The
extreme northern end of the northern continent is called <i>Terra de Cuba</i>.
Along the western shore are the words <i>Ultra mondv lustratum</i>. West of the
northern continent lie the large island of <i>Zipangri</i> and a multitude of islets.
The north Pacific is called <i>Orientalis Oceanus</i>. Cortés' chart of the Gulf of
Mexico, 1520, is a rough draft of oval shape with several names along the
coast, many of which are obsolete. Yucatan is represented as an island.
In 1860 J. G. Kohl published at Weimar a dissertation on two of the oldest
general maps of America, with the origin of the names on each. The maps
were those of Fernando Colon, 1527, and Diego Ribero, 1529, then in the
grand-ducal library at Weimar. The text accompanying these fac-similes is
entitled <i>Die Beiden Ältesten General-Karten von Amerika</i>. <i>Ausgeführt in den
Jahren 1527 und 1529, auf Befehl Kaiser Karl's V.</i> The maps being full of
names, concerning many of which there has been much discussion, 185 royal
folio pages are devoted to their explanation. Beside a critical review of
nomenclature is given much information, both geographical and historical.
Colon's map shows the eastern coasts of North and South America, and the
southern shores of the Isthmus and Central America to about Nicaragua.
Ribero's map contains more names than Colon's, and a section of the Peruvian
coast; otherwise they are not unlike. Continuing the present list we have all
of South America, and part of North America, given in 1527 by Robert Thorne;
and the western side of the New World in 1528 by Bordone. Ptolemy, in
<i>Munster</i>, <i>Cosmography</i>, 1530, gives the two Americas entirely surrounded by
water, with Yucatan an island; in the interior of Mexico <i>Chamaho</i>, and <i>Temistitan</i>;
and near Zipangu <i>Archipelagus 7448 insularum</i>, counted in all probability
specially for this map. Orontius Fine's globe, 1531, unites the southern
continent, which it calls America, by the isthmus <i>dariena</i> to the northern,
which extends toward the north-west across the ocean and forms part of Asia,
with a continuous coast line to Japan. The Atlantic is <i>Alanticum</i>, and the
Pacific <i>Mar del Sur</i>. Yucatan is an island. It is difficult to tell where
Mexico ends and Asia begins. <i>Temistitan</i> is just south of <i>Catay</i>, and
Mexican and Asiatic names promiscuously occur. Grynæus, in 1532, gives
America in two parts, divided by a strait at the Isthmus; the western end
of the northern continent is called <i>Terra de Cuba</i>. Map vi., <i>Munich Atlas</i>,
1532-40, shows the Pacific coast from Peru to California, which is represented
as a peninsula. The gulf of California is called the Red Sea. Yucatan
is an island. Baptista Agnese, 1536, gives North America in the shape of a
horseshoe, with Yucatan an island. Map vii., <i>Munich Atlas</i>, is supposed to
be by Baptista Agnese, 1540-50. It shows the whole of the Atlantic coast,
and the Pacific coast from Peru to Mexico. Ramusio, <i>Viaggi</i>, iii. fol. 455-56,
1565, lays down about half the Pacific coast. Maps ix. x. and xii., <i>Munich
Atlas</i>, are supposed to have been drawn by Vaz Dourado in 1571. The first
delineates South America, and a small part of the Isthmus; the second both
shores of Central America, and the Gulf of Mexico; the third the Pacific
coast only from Mexico to Anian Strait. On map x. is a large lake north of
Mexico, in latitude 40° to 43°, and under it in large letters, <i>Bimenii Regio</i>.
Gerard Mercator, <i>Atlas sive cosmographicæ</i>, 1569, and another edition 1574,
represents the world on two globes, and surrounds the two Americas with
water, beside capping either pole with a huge continent. In the north-eastern
corner of Asia, map iv., is <i>Americæ pars</i>. There are also <i>Anian
reg</i>, <i>Quiuira reg</i>, <i>Tuchano</i>, a city, and <i>El freto de Anian</i>. On map v. the
strait of Magellan separates the southern continent from another large continent
to the south of it, on which is placed <i>Terra del fuego</i>. Luckily this
antarctic polar continent is labeled <i>Terra Avstralis nondvm cognita</i>, lest
the author be embarrassed by questions about it. After well passing the
strait of Magellan, <i>El Mar Pacifico</i> is entered, though as the tropics are
reached it becomes <i>Mar del Zur</i>. The northern part of this map v.,
the two Americas, is quite interesting, and will be explained elsewhere.
This cartographical monstrosity Michael Lock, <i>Hakluyt's Divers Voy.</i>, 1582,
endeavored, and with very fair success, to exceed. Map xiii., <i>Munich
Atlas</i>, by Thomas Hood, 1592, gives the Gulf of Mexico, the Islands,
and the eastern coast of North America. In <i>Drake's World Encompassed</i>,
1595, another source of information not remarkable for reliability, Hondius
traces the western coast to Bering Strait. Hondius' map, 1625, in <i>Purchas</i>,
<i>His Pilgrimes</i>, iv. 857, gives North America to the mythical strait of
Anian. Ioanne de Laet, <i>Novvs Orbis</i>, 1633, has at p. 220 a map of <i>Nveva
España</i>, <i>Nveva Galicia</i>, and <i>Gvatimala</i>, and at p. 346 a map of <i>Tierra Firma</i>.
A map of the world in the atlas of Jacob Colom, 1663, will require mention
hereafter. <i>Ogilby's America</i>, 1671, gives the northern continent to Anian
Strait with <i>Nova Albion</i> in the northern part, and California as an island;
and a map at p. 222 shows parts of Mexico and Central America. There is a
map of the middle part of America in <i>Dampier's Voyages</i>, i. 44, 1699. Beside
these, I shall have occasion to mention others, such as the maps in the
<i>Buccaniers of America</i>, 1704;
<i>Funnell's Voyage</i>, 1707; the Dutch collection of
voyages by Pieter Van der Aa; the German collection of Gottfried;
<i>Voyages
de François Coreal</i>, 1722;
<i>Anson's Voyage</i>, 1756;
<i>Morden's Geography Rectified</i>,
1693; Harris, Harleian, Oxford, Rogers, Shelvocke, Jefferys, and other collections
of voyages. I may also mention incidentally in this volume maps and
charts relating more especially to another part of the Pacific States and
described more fully in a succeeding volume.

al Canal de Zerabora, que son 6 leguas de largo, i mas de tres de ancho,
en el qual, ai muchas Isletas, i tres, ò quatro Bocas mui à proposito para entrar.'
And Mr Kohl remarks, <i>Beiden ältesten Karten</i>, 115, 'Diese Schilderung
passt auf kein anderes Gewässer südlich vom San Juan 'Cariay,' als auf unsere
'Laguna de Chiriqui,' die auch wohl noch heutiges Tages besonders in ihrer
westlichen Abtheilung 'Baia del Almirante' ... genannt wird.' Ribero places
<i>ys<sup>a</sup> de cerebaro</i> in the laguna. Vaz Dourado writes <i>Carabare</i>; Maiollo puts
here somewhere <i>la casera bruxada</i>, and near by <i>oro boro</i>. Mercator makes
<i>Cerebaro</i> a town. Hondius, in <i>Purchas</i>, <i>His Pilgrimes</i>, places in this vicinity
the town, <i>Quicari</i>. <i>West-Indische Spieghel</i>, 1624, gives <i>Carabaro</i>, and a little
to the north a town, <i>Quicura</i>.

Columbus, who were called dukes of Veraguas. Peter Martyr, Colon, and
Ribero, all write <i>beragua</i>; Vaz Dourado, <i>baraga</i>; Ptolemy, <i>Beragua</i>, as a

<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_IV-17'>[IV-17]</a></span> The locality of this little harbor was soon lost. Herrera affirms that in
his time its situation was uncertain, some believing Nombre de Dios to be the
place mentioned. Peschel locates it near the town of Colon; Humboldt at
Puerto de Escribanos. Ribero places fifteen leagues west of Nombre de Dios,
<i>p<sup>o</sup> retre</i>. Kohl says, <i>Beiden ältesten Karten</i>, 116: 'Er findet sich nicht auf
N. Vallard (1547), nicht auf Dourado (1580) und nicht auf den Karten vom
Isthmus von Darien in Herrera.' But it would seem from the description of
Fernando Colon, <i>Hist. Almirante</i>, 110, in <i>Barcia</i>, i., that the place should be
easily enough found. He says:—'entramos en vn Puertecillo, que se llamò el
<i>Retrete</i>, porque no cabian en èl mas de 5 ò 6 Navios; su entrada era por vna
boca de quince, ò veinte pasos de ancho, i ambos lados eran Rocas, que salian del
Agua, como punta de Diamante, i era tan profundo de Canal, por enmedio, que
acercandose à la orilla, vn poco, se podia saltar desde el Navio en Tierra.'

<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_IV-18'>[IV-18]</a></span> Although the authorities are somewhat vague and conflicting as to the
terminal point of the main-land coastings of Bastidas, there is no doubt that
the two discoveries here united. Oviedo, ii. 334-36, and those copying his
errors, take Bastidas direct from Urabá to Jamaica; but Las Casas, <i>Hist. Ind.</i>,
iii. 11, states:—'Salieron del golfo de Urabá, y fueron la costa del Poniente
abajo, y llegaron al puerto que llamaron del Retrete, donde agora está la ciudad
y puerto que nombramos del Nombre de Dios.' Later, in chapter xxiii.
123, he corrects himself in regard to El Retrete and Nombre de Dios being the
same place:—'Por esto parece que el puerto del Retrete no es el que agora
llamamos del Nombre de Dios, como arriba dijimos por relacion de otros, sino
más adelante, hácia el Oriente.' Speaking of El Retrete, Diego de Porras,
<i>Navarrete</i>, <i>Col. de Viages</i>, i. 285, remarks:—'En algunas cartas de navegar de
algunos de los marineros juntaba esta tierra con la que habian descubierto Hojeda
y Bastidas.' Navarrete himself, <i>Col. de Viages</i>, iii. 26, says of Bastidas,
'terminó su descubrimiento por los diez grados de altura en el puerto del Retrete
ó de Escribanos y del nombre de Dios;' and again in a note concerning
Nombre de Dios:—'En este puerto entró posteriormente el Almirante Colon
el dia 26 de Noviembre de 1502 con noticia que ya tenia de los descubrimientos
de Bastidas.' Gomara, <i>Hist. Ind.</i>, 67, accredits Bastidas with the new
discovery of 170 leagues of coast, 'que ay del cabo de la Vela al golfo de Vraua,
y Farallones del Darien,' resting with Oviedo at that point. From the evidence
Humboldt, <i>Exam. Crit.</i>, i. 360, infers that Bastidas continued 'vers
l'ouest jusqu'au Puerto de Retrete.' Loose statements are quite the habit
now as of old; instance that of Lerdo de Tejada, who says, <i>Apuntes Hist.</i>, 89,
referring to Bastidas, 'Y siguió hasta el puerto llamado despues el <i>Retiro</i>,
donde se fundó posteriormente el del <i>Nombre de Dios</i>.'

<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_IV-24'>[IV-24]</a></span> There are two accounts of this affair; one by Fernando Colon, and one
by Diego Mendez. Both are biased; the former in favor of Bartolomé, the
latter in favor of the writer. Fernando tells how, when the settlement was
taken by surprise, his uncle seized a lance, and supported by seven men fought
with desperate valor until the main body of the Spaniards came to his relief,
when the enemy was routed. The other states, <i>Relacion hecha por Diego
Mendez</i>, in <i>Navarrete</i>, <i>Col. de Viages</i>, i. 317, that the admiral had just left the
harbor, accompanied by the larger part of the Spaniards, who had gone to
say farewell. Mendez, newly appointed contador, held the town of Belen
with twenty men. Suddenly four hundred Indians appeared on the hill
above, and sent upon the Spaniards a shower of darts and arrows. Fortunately
the yells were in advance of the weapons, and thus time was given
Mendez to arm. The fight was desperate, and lasted three hours. Ten
natives who ventured to close with their war clubs were slain by the sword.
Seven of the twenty Christians were killed; but a miracle at last gave victory
to the remainder. During the next four days, by the ingenuity of Mendez,
and under his direction, the effects of the colony were placed on shipboard,
and in return for his invaluable services he was made captain of Tristan's ship.

<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_IV-25'>[IV-25]</a></span> The final burial-place, not only of Columbus, but of his son Diego, and
of his grandson Luis, was the cathedral of Santo Domingo. For seven years
after his death the remains of Columbus lay in the convent of San Francisco
at Valladolid. Then they were removed to Seville and placed in the monastery
of Las Cuevas; and in 1536 were transferred to Santo Domingo.
When Española was ceded to France in 1795, the Spanish naval commander
asked permission to remove the remains to Cuba, which was granted; and
what were supposed to be the remains were so removed midst pomp and ceremony
in December-January following. But later investigations, the result of
long-standing suspicions, satisfied many that a blunder had been committed;
and that the bones of Columbus still rest at Santo Domingo. This has been
proved beyond a doubt by the recent researches of the distinguished French
savant and Americaniste A. Pinart.

of Roldan, who was to be returned to Spain. Irving, <i>Columbus</i>, ii. 331, writes
erroneously <i>alguazil mayor</i>, evidently confounding the two offices. For Las
Casas, <i>Hist. Ind.</i>, iii. 18, says plainly enough:—'Trujo consigo por Alcalde
mayor un caballero de Salamanca y licenciado, llamado Alonso Maldonado.'
An alguacil mayor was a chief constable, or high sheriff, a very different
person from a chief judge. These terms, and the offices represented by them,
will be fully explained in another place.
</p>

<p class='footnote' id='FN_V-2'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_V-2'>[V-2]</a></span> As this word will often occur in these pages, and as neither the term nor
the institution it symbolizes has any equivalent in English, I will enter here
a full explanation. <i>Residencia</i> was the examination or account taken of the
official acts of an executive or judicial officer during the term of his <i>residence</i>
within the province of his jurisdiction, and while in the exercise of the
functions of his office. This was done at the expiration of the term of office,
or at stated periods, or in case of malefeasance at any time. The person
making the examination was appointed by the king, or in New World affairs
by the <i>Consejo de Indias</i>, or by a viceroy, and was called a <i>juez de residencia</i>.
Before this judge, within a given time, any one might appear
and make complaint, and offer evidence against the retiring or suspended
official, who might refute and rebut as in an ordinary tribunal. The residencia
of any officer appointed by the crown must be taken by a judge
appointed by the crown; the residencia of officers appointed in the Indies
by viceroys, audiencias, or president-governors, was taken by a judge
appointed by the same authority. Following are some of the changes rung
upon the subject by royal decrees, the better to make it fit the government
of the Indies. The 10th of June, 1523, and again the 17th of November,
1526, Charles V. decreed that appeal might be made from the judge of residencia
to the Council of the Indies, except in private demands not exceeding
600 pesos de oro, when appeal was to the audiencia. In 1530 viceroys and
president-governors were directed to take the residencia of <i>visitadores de
Indios</i> that wrong-doing to the natives might not escape punishment; and by
a later law proclamations of residencias must be made in such manner that
the Indians might know thereof. The <i>Ordenanzas de Audiencias</i> of Philip II. of
1563 and 1567, state that in some cities of the Indies it was customary to
appoint at certain seasons two regidores, who, with an alcalde, acted as
<i>fieles ejecutores</i>. At the beginning of every year the viceroy, or the president,
in a city which was the residence of an audiencia, had to appoint an <i>oidor</i> to
take the residencia of the fieles ejecutores of the previous year. The same
was to be done if those offices had been sold to the city, <i>villa</i>, or <i>lugar</i>; but
in such cases it was left to the discretion of the viceroy or president to cause
them to be taken when necessary, not allowing them to become too commonplace.
Philip II. in 1573, and his successors as late as 1680, directed that in
residencias of governors and their subordinates, when the fine did not exceed
20,000 maravedís, execution should issue immediately; in damages granted
from private demands to the amount of 200 ducats, the condemned was to
give bonds to respond. While an official was undergoing his residencia it
was equivalent to his being under arrest, as he could neither exercise office
nor, except in certain cases specified, leave the place. Thus the law of 1530,
reiterated in 1581, stated that from the time of the proclamation of a residencia
till its conclusion <i>alguaciles mayores</i> and their <i>tenientes</i> should be suspended
from carrying the <i>varas</i>, or from exercising any of the functions of
office. In 1583, in 1620, and in 1680, it was ordered that such judges of residencia
as were appointed in the Indies should be selected by a viceroy and
audiencia, or by a president and audiencia, acting in accord. Salaries of
jueces de residencia were ordered by Felipe III. in 1618 to be paid by the
official tried if found guilty, if not by the audiencia appointing. Before this,
in 1610, the same sovereign had ordered notaries employed in residencias
taken by <i>corregidores</i> to be paid in like manner. The next monarch directed
that ships' officers should be subject to residencia in the form of a <i>visita</i>; and
in visitas to <i>galeones</i> and <i>flotas</i> none but common sailors, artillerymen, and
soldiers should be exempt. Cárlos II. in 1667 decreed that the residencia
of a viceroy must be terminated within six months from the publication of
the notice of the judge taking it. Felipe III. in 1619, and Cárlos II. in
1680, ordered that viceroys and presidents should send annually to the crown
lists of persons suitable for conducting residencias, so that no one might be
chosen to act upon the official under whose jurisdiction he resided. See
<i>Recop. de Indias</i>, ii. 176-89. Of the report of the residencia the original
was sent to the Council of the Indies, and a copy deposited in the archives
of the audiencia. So burdensome were these trials, so corrupt became the
judges, that later, in America, the residencia seemed rather to defeat than to
promote justice, and in 1799 it was abolished so far as the subordinate officers
were concerned.

<p class='footnote' id='FN_V-3'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_V-3'>[V-3]</a></span> Originally written <i>fijodalgo</i>, son of something. Later applied to gentlemen,
country gentlemen perhaps more particularly. Oviedo, ii. 466, calls
Diego de Nicuesa 'hombre de limpia sangre de hijosdalgo,' a man of pure gentle
blood. Concerning the origin of the word <i>hidalgo</i>, Juan de la Puente states
that during the Moorish wars, whenever a large town was captured the king
kept it; the villages he gave to captains who had distinguished themselves, and
who were called at first <i>ricos homes</i>, and afterward <i>grandes</i>. To minor meritorious
persons something less was given, a portion of the spoils or a grant of
land, but always something; hence their descendants were called <i>fijosdalgos</i>,
<i>hijosdalgos</i>, or <i>hidalgos</i>, sons of something. In the <i>Dic. Univ.</i> authorities are
quoted showing that the word <i>hidalgo</i> originated with the Roman colonists
of Spain, called <i>Itálicos</i>, who were exempt from imposts. Hence those
enjoying similar benefits were called <i>Itálicos</i>, which word in lapse of time
became <i>hidalgo</i>.

<p class='footnote' id='FN_V-5'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_V-5'>[V-5]</a></span> The best proof of the policy of Spain in regard to the natives of the
New World is found in her laws upon the subject. Writers may possibly
color their assertions, but by following the royal decrees through successive
reigns we have what cannot be controverted. The subject of the
treatment of the Indians occupies no inconsiderable space in the <i>Recopilacion
de Leyes de las Indias</i>. At the beginning of tit. x. lib. vi. is placed a clause of
Isabella's will, solemnly enjoining her successors to see that the Indians were
always equitably and kindly treated; and this was the text for future legislation.
And now let us glance at the laws; I cannot give them all; but I
can assure the reader they are of one tenor. First of all the natives were
to be protected by the ecclesiastical and civil authorities. They might marry
freely, but always in accordance with Christian usage; must not be taken to
Spain; must be civilized, Christianized, taught to speak Spanish, and to love
labor, if possible; they might sow seed, breed stock, keep their ancient
market-days, buy and sell at pleasure, and even dispose of their lands,
only the Spaniards were not allowed to sell them arms or alcoholic liquors.
The Inquisition could not touch them, for in religious matters they were subject
to the bishop's jurisdiction, and in cases of witchcraft to the civil power.
They might have their municipal organizations in imitation of the Spanish
town government, with their alcaldes, fiscales, and regidores, elected from
among themselves to serve for one year, elections to be held in the presence
of the priest. It was made the duty of priests, prelates, all officers of the
government, and in fact every Spanish subject, to watch over and protect
the Indians. Governors and judges were charged under the severest penalties
to see justice done them. Two officers were created at an early day
for this purpose, those of <i>protector</i> and <i>defensor</i>, the former having general
oversight of the natives and their interests, and the latter appearing in their
behalf in court. After a time, when it was thought the aborigines could
stand alone, the offices were abolished. But the action was premature, and
in 1589 Philip II. ordered them revived. These officers were appointed by
the viceroys and president-governors. Indians might appear in courts of law
and have counsel assigned them free of any cost; and even in suits between
the natives themselves there was to be no expense, the fiscal appearing on
one side, and the protector on the other. Philip also gave notice in 1593 that
Spaniards who maltreated Indians were to be punished with greater rigor
than for badly treating a Spaniard. This was a remarkable law; it is a
pity the Puritans and their descendants lacked such a one. Indians might
be hired, but they must be paid promptly. They might work in the mines,
or carry burdens if they chose, but it must be done voluntarily. Enforced
personal service, or any approach to it, was jealously and repeatedly prohibited.
Indians under eighteen must not be employed to carry burdens.
Let those who sneer at Philip and Spain remember that two centuries after
this England could calmly look on and see her own little children, six years
of age, working with their mothers in coal-pits. There were many ways the
Spaniards had of evading the just and humane laws of their monarchs—instance
the trick of employers of getting miners or other laborers in debt to
them, and keeping them so, and if they attempted to run away interpose the
law for their restraint. It was equivalent to slavery. A native might even
sell his labor for an indefinite time, until Felipe III. in 1618 decreed that no
Indian could bind himself to work for more than one year. The law endeavored
to throw all severe labor upon the negro, who was supposed to be
better able to endure it. The black man was likewise placed far below the
red in the social scale. It was criminal for a negro or mixed-breed to have
an Indian work for him, although voluntarily and for pay; nor might an
African even go to the house of an American. The law endeavored to guard
the Indian in his privacy, as well as in his rights. It studied to make the
lot of the aboriginal as peaceful and comfortable under Christian civilization
as under heathen barbarism. More it could not do; it could not do this
much; after the pacifying raid through the primeval garden, all Europe
could not restore it. But Spain's monarchs did their best to mitigate the
sufferings caused by Spain's unruly sons. The cacique might hold his place
among his people, and follow ancient usage in regard to his succession, but he
must not enslave them, or inflict upon them the ancient cruel customs, such
as giving Indian girls in lieu of tribute, or burying servants with their dead
masters. And these petty rulers must stay at home and attend to their affairs;
Indians could not leave one pueblo to take up their residence in another, and
caciques could not go to Spain without special license from the king. The
natives were ordered to live in communities, and have a fixed residence, and
their lands were not in consequence to be taken from them. They must not
ride on horseback, for that would make them too nearly equal to the cavalier
in battle; they must not hold dances without permission, for then they might
plot conspiracies, or give themselves up to serve heathen gods as of old;
they must not work in gold or silver, an illiberal restriction which lost
to the world the finest of America's arts. Spaniards could not place a
cattle rancho within 1½ leagues of a native pueblo; or swine, sheep, or goats
within half a league; the Indians might lawfully kill cattle trespassing on
their lands. In a pueblo of Indians neither Spaniard, nor mulatto, nor negro
should live. No traveller might spend the night at the house of a native if
an inn was at hand. No Spanish or mestizo merchant might remain in an
Indian pueblo more than three days, nor another white man more than two
days. Beside the property of individuals each Indian pueblo had some common
property, and a strong-box in which the community money and title-deeds
were kept. Caciques must not call themselves lords of pueblos, as
that detracted from royal preëminence; they must be called caciques simply.
The cacique must not attempt feudal fashions; he must not oppress his
people, or take more than the stipulated tribute; and he who worked for
the cacique must be paid by the cacique. In criminal matters the jurisdiction
of caciques over their people could not extend to death or mutilation.
On the other hand a cacique could not be tried by the ordinary Spanish justice
of the peace, but only by the judge of a district. The last four laws were made
by Charles V. in 1538. And beside these were many other edicts promulgated
by the Spanish monarchs during two and a half centuries, notable for their
wisdom, energy, and humanity. By the continued outrages and excesses of
their subjects in the New World the temper of the crown was often severely
tried. Thus was found written by Felipe IV. with his own hand, on a decree
of the council ordering the immediate suppression of all those infamous evils
practised in spite of laws against them, a sentiment which was fully reiterated
by his son Cárlos II. in 1680:—'I will that you give satisfaction to me and
to the world concerning the manner of treating those my vassals,' so reads
the writing; 'and if this be not done, so that as in response to this letter
I may see exemplary punishment meted offenders, I shall hold myself disobeyed;
and be assured that if you do not remedy it, I will. The least omissions
I shall consider grave crimes against God and against me; the evil conduct
tending as it does to the total ruin and destruction of those realms whose
natives I hold in estimation; and I will that they be treated as is merited by
vassals who serve the monarchy so well, and have so contributed to its grandeur
and enlightenment.' See further, <i>Tapia</i>, <i>Hist. Civ. Española</i>, passim;

<i>encomendar</i>, to give in charge;
<i>encomendero</i>, he who
holds an encomienda. In Spain an encomienda, as here understood, was
a dignity in the four military orders, endowed with a rental, and held
by certain members of the order. It was acquired through the liberality
of the crown as a reward for services in the wars against the Moors.
The lands taken from the Infidels were divided among Christian commanders;
the inhabitants of those lands were crown tenants, and life-rights
to their services were given these commanders. In the legislation
of the Indies, encomienda was the patronage conferred by royal favor over
a portion of the natives, coupled with the obligation to teach them the
doctrines of the Church, and to defend their persons and property. It was
originally intended that the recipients of these favors were to be the discoverers,
conquerors, meritorious settlers, and their descendants; but in this as
in many other respects the wishes of the monarchs and their advisers did not
always reach the mark. The system begun in the New World by Columbus,
Bobadilla, and Ovando was continued by Vasco Nuñez, Pedrarias, Cortés,
and Pizarro, and finally became general. Royal decrees upon the subject,
which seemed to grow more and more intricate as new possessions were pacified,
began with a law by Ferdinand the Catholic in 1509, reiterated by Philip
II. in 1580, to the effect that immediately upon the pacification of a province
the governor should divide the natives among the settlers. The natives
thus distributed were held for a term of years, or during the life of the
holder, or for two or more lives—that is, during the life of the first holder,
and that of his heir, and perhaps that of his heir's heir, or until the king
should otherwise decree. <i>Solorzano</i>, <i>De Indiarum Jure</i>, ii. lib. ii. cap. i.;
<i>Acosta</i>,
<i>De Procur. Ind.</i>, iii. cap. x. When by this course three fourths of certain
populations had been 'recommended' to their death, at the representation
of Las Casas, the king in 1523 decreed that 'as God our lord had made
the Indians free,' they must not be enslaved on this or any other pretext;
'and therefore we command that it be done no more, and that those
already distributed be set at liberty.' <i>Remesal</i>, <i>Hist. Chyapa</i>, 10. But by
this abolition the destruction of the colonies was threatened. Petition
followed petition for the restoration of the system, until the king finally
yielded. <i>Solorzano</i>, <i>Política Indiana</i>, i. 225. In 1542 encomiendas were again
abolished, and again the king was obliged to restore them. Meanwhile
every effort possible was made by the crown to prevent abuses. The encomendero
must fulfil in person the intention of the law. He must not leave
without permission from the governor, and then his duties must be delegated
to a responsible agent. If away for four months without permission,
his encomienda was to be declared vacant. The encomendero must not hire
out any natives, or pledge them to creditors, under penalty of loss of Indians
and a fine of 50,000 maravedís. No one could appropriate any natives except
those legally assigned. When it was seen how those in office misused their
power, in 1530, in 1532, in 1542, in 1551, and in 1563 all civil and ecclesiastical
functionaries were forbidden to hold encomiendas; but in 1544 Philip II.
excepted from this prohibition <i>tenientes de gobernadores</i>, <i>corregidores</i>, and <i>alcaldes
mayores de pueblos</i>. Indians should not be given in encomienda to the
daughters of royal officials, or to sons unless married. It was just and reasonable
that the savages should pay the Spaniards tribute, for so God had appointed,
so the pope had ordained, and the king had commanded; but it
was the collection of this tribute only, and not the deprivation of liberty, or
of any personal rights, that the encomienda was intended to cover. And for
this tax, which whosoever enjoys the boon of civilization must surely pay,
the vassal was to receive protection, and the still more blessed boon of
Christianity. Nor must this impost under any consideration be made burdensome.</p>

<p class="footnote">
The manner of making assessments was minutely defined by edicts of
Charles V. at divers dates from 1528 to 1555, and of Philip II. from the beginning
to the end of his reign. In substance they were as follows. The
king made responsible to him the viceroys, and the presidents and audiencias,
who, by the aid of a commissioner and assessors, fixed the rates in their respective
districts. The assessors having first heard a solemn mass of the Holy
Ghost, in order to enlighten their understanding that they might justly regard
the value of the rental and equitably determine the rate, they were to swear
with all solemnity before the priest this to do without bias. They were personally
to inspect all the pueblos of the province, noting the number of settlers
and natives in each pueblo, and the quality of the land. They were to ascertain
what the natives had originally paid to their caciques as tribute, and
never make the new rate higher, but always lower, than the old one. For
surely they should not be worse off in serving Spain than in serving their
heathen lords. After thus carefully examining the resources and capabilities
of the tributaries, and never infringing on the comfort of the women
and children, the assessors should fix the rate according to God and their
conscience. The natives might pay in money if they preferred, but payment
should be required only in kind, in whatever produce grew on their
lands. They must not be required to raise anything specially for this purpose;
and from not over two or three kinds of produce should tribute be
taken; a few chickens, or a pig or two, need not be counted at all. It was
the intention of the monarchs that from a tenth to a fifth might in this way
be taken, though the encomendero too often managed to get twice or thrice as
much, or all the natives had. The Indians must be made to understand how
the appraisement was made, and that it was not done in the interests of the
Spaniards alone. Then the assessor must put in writing what each had to pay,
and leave the original with the cacique, giving one copy to the encomendero,
and sending one to the Council of the Indies, or to the viceroy, or to the audiencia.
For the encomendero to practise extortion, or demand more than
the schedule called for, there were pronounced the severest penalties, even to
the loss of the encomienda and half his goods. Natives voluntarily coming
forward and entering in encomienda were excused from paying tribute for ten
years; and, in any event, for the first two years after congregating in pueblos
but one half the usual tribute could be legally exacted. Males were taxed
after the eighteenth year; caciques, elder sons, women, and alcaldes in office
were exempt. After the gift, the encomienda was the property of the encomendero,
not to be taken from him before the expiration of his term without
cause. In every encomienda there must be a church, and where there was
none, the natives must be stimulated to build one, the priest to be paid out
of the rental. In every pueblo of 100 or more natives, two or three must be
taught to sing, so that they might act as choristers; also a native sacristan—these
to be exempt from tribute. In 1568 Philip II. ordered that no encomendero
should receive a rental of over 2000 pesos; any excess was to be returned
to the crown and employed as pensions. The same monarch directed in 1573
that when an encomienda fell vacant, a viceroy or governor might, if he deemed
best, appropriate the rental to benevolent objects, and defer granting it again
till the king's pleasure should be known. And again, in 1583, that the encomendero
must have a house of his own, built of stone for purposes of defence,
in the city of his residence; and he must keep his family there. He
should maintain no house in the town of the Indians, nor should he have any
building there except a granary. In 1592 it was decreed that Indians in encomienda
could be given to none but residents in the Indies. When an encomienda
became vacant, so it was decreed in 1594 and subsequently, the fact was
advertised for from twenty to thirty days, during which time applicants might
prefer their respective claims, and recite services rendered the crown by themselves
or their ancestors. Preference was always to be given to the descendants
of discoverers and settlers. Two or three small encomiendas might sometimes
be joined in one. And never might religious training be forgotten; when the
rental was not sufficient for the support of the encomendero and the instructor,
the latter must have the revenue. Felipe III. in 1602, 1611, 1616, 1618,
and 1620, decreed that as a rule but one encomienda could be held by one
person; still more seldom could one be given up and another taken. There
was to be no such thing as commerce in them. They were a trust. Much
evil had arisen from dividing encomiendas, and it should be done no more.
Felipe IV. in 1655 ordered that governors under royal commission and those
named by the viceroy <i>ad interim</i> might give Indians in encomienda, but <i>alcaldes
ordinarios</i> holding temporarily the office of governor were not allowed this
privilege. <i>Recop. de Indias</i>, ii. 249-284 and passim. Finally, toward the close
of the seventeenth century, the monarchs, becoming more and more straitened
in their need of money, ordered that encomenderos should pay a portion of their
revenue to the crown; then a larger portion was demanded; and then the whole
of it. In 1721 the system came to an end. But after endeavoring for two
hundred years to get back what they had given away, the monarchs found
there was nothing left of it, the natives having by this time merged with
sometimes slightly whitened skins into the civilized pueblos.

should have an <i>arca de tres llaves</i>, a chest of three keys; after which the government
strong-box became common in Spanish America. It was usually in
the form of a sailor's chest, of heavy wood bound with brass or iron, and
having three locks fastening the lid by hasps. The strong-box of the India
House, the law goes on to say, must remain in the custody of the treasurer,
who was responsible for its safe keeping. One of the keys was held by the
<i>tesorero</i>, one by the <i>contador</i>, and one by the <i>factor</i>. Out of the hand of any
one of these three royal officers his key could not lawfully go; and no one
but they might put into the chest or take out of it any thing, under penalty,
on the official permitting it, of four times the value of the things so handled.
In this box were kept, temporarily, all gold, silver, pearls, and precious

<p class='footnote' id='FN_V-10'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_V-10'>[V-10]</a></span> The word <i>audiencia</i>, from <i>audire</i>, to hear, has a variety of significations
in Spanish; meaning, namely, the act of hearing, the tribunal, the courtroom
and building, and finally, jurisdiction. <i>Oidor</i>, he who hears, comes
from the same root, but is now applied only to the magistrate of an audiencia.
The more important general laws governing audiencias in the New
World were the following. In 1528 the emperor ordered, and the decree was
reiterated in 1548, 1569, 1575, and 1589, that each audiencia should make a
tariff of fees of notaries and other officers, which must not exceed five times
those in Spain. In 1530 the mandates of this tribunal were made of equal
force with those of the king himself. Should any one demand it, decisions in
civil suits were to be rendered in one case before another was begun; suits
of poor persons always to have preference in time of hearing. Even dissenting
judges must sign the decision, making it unanimous. On the first
business day of each year, all the members and officers being present, the laws
governing audiencias should be read. In 1541 the emperor ordered that in
'first instance' alcaldes, regidores, alguaciles mayores, and escribanos should
not be brought before the audiencia; in each pueblo one alcalde should have
cognizance of what affected the other, and both of matters concerning its
other officers. In 1540, and many times thereafter, the audiencia was
charged to look to the welfare of the natives, to watch narrowly the conduct
of governors and other officials, and to punish excesses. While in October,
1545, the emperor was at Malines, hence known as the law of Malinas,
directions were given for procedure in cases of claims of Indians. <i>Menor
cuantía</i> in suits was fixed at 300,000 maravedís; not exceeding this amount
two oidores might decide; also in suits of <i>mayor cuantía</i>, except at Lima and
Mexico where three votes were necessary as in Spanish law. It was ordered
in 1548 that audiencias must not meddle with questions of rank and precedence.
In 1551, Saturdays and two other days in the week were set aside,
there being no suits of poor persons, for hearing disputes between Indians,
and between Indians and Spaniards. More <i>casos de corte</i>, that is important
suits taken from lower courts, were not to be admitted by an audiencia of
the Indies than was customary in Spain. This was in 1552, and repeated in
1572. In 1553 it was ordered that any person having a grievance against a
president or viceroy might appeal to the audiencia, the accused officer being
forbidden to preside at such times. If the president was a bishop he was not
permitted to adjudicate in matters ecclesiastic. Six years later all petitions
presented were to be admitted. Philip II. in 1561 ordered that suits of the
royal treasury should have precedence over all others. The year 1563 was
prolific in regulations for the audiencia. Where the president of an audiencia
was governor and captain-general, the tribunal should not meddle in matters
of war, unless the president was absent, or unless specially directed by the
crown. In the city where the audiencia is held there must be an Audiencia
House, and the president must live there, and keep there the royal seal, the
registry, the jail, and the mint; in this house must be a striking clock;
and if there be no such building provided, the residence of the president
shall in the mean time be so used. On every day not a feast-day the
audiencia must sit at least three hours, beginning at 7 <span class="smcap">a.&nbsp;m.</span> in summer, and
8 <span class="smcap">a.&nbsp;m.</span> in winter, and at least three oidores must be present. Audiencias
must not annul sentences of exile; or, unless bonds for payment are given,
grant letters of delay to condemned treasury debtors. The majority decide.
The governor, alcalde mayor, or other person refusing obedience to any mandate
of the tribunal must be visited by a judge and punished. In exceptional
cases only the audiencia might touch the royal treasury. Each audiencia must
keep a book in which was to be recorded—where the amount in question was
over 100,000 maravedís, or, in other important cases—the verdict of each
oidor; and the president must swear to keep secret the contents of this book
unless ordered by the king to divulge the same. A book should also be kept
in which was to be entered anything affecting the treasury; and another the
fines imposed. Audiencias could appoint only to certain offices. Philip II.
further ordered during the subsequent years of his reign, that audiencias
must keep secret the instructions from the crown; that they must not interfere
with the lower courts, or with the courts of ecclesiastics, except in
cases provided by law, but rather aid them; that they should register the
names of persons coming from Spain, with their New World address; that
with such matters as residencias, compelling married men to live with
their wives, and the estates of deceased persons, presidents and viceroys
should not intermeddle, but leave them to the other members; that they
should use no funds resulting from their judgments, but draw on the treasury
for expenses; that when an audiencia was to be closed, a governor should be
appointed with power to continue and determine pending suits, but he
should institute no new suits, and appeals lie to the nearest audiencia; that
they should not make public the frailties of ecclesiastics, but examine charges
against them in secret; that royal despatches for the audiencia must not be
opened by the president alone, but at an <i>acuerdo</i>, and in presence of the
oidores and fiscal, and if thought necessary the <i>escribano de cámara</i> must be
present; and that they must not remit to the Council of the Indies trivial
matters for decision. In subsequent reigns during the seventeenth century
it was at various times decreed that a president might impeach an oidor
before the Council of the Indies, though he could not send him to Spain, but
no oidor might impeach his president except by royal command; that audiencias
should exercise their functions in love and temperance, especially
during a vacancy in the office of president or viceroy; that in their visits to
the jail the oidores should not entertain petitions of those condemned to
death by the ordinary justices in consultation with the criminal section
of the audiencia, nor should they on such visits take cognizance of anything
not specially confided to them; that they should not legitimize natural
children, but refer such cases to the Council of the Indies; that each year
the president should designate an oidor to oversee the officers and attachés
and punish their faults; that no favoritism should be shown appointees of
viceroys or presidents; one oidor might transact business, if the audiencia
were reduced to that extremity; in arriving at a decision the junior member
should vote first, then the next youngest, and so on up to the senior member.
This from the <i>Recopilacion de las Indias</i>, i. 323-70. In the <i>Politica Indiana</i>
of Solorzano, ii. 271-82, may be found how the audiencias of America differed
from those of Spain. Larger powers were given the former by reason
of their distance from the throne. They were given jurisdiction in the
residencias of the inferior judiciary; they could commission <i>pesquisidores</i>, or
special judges, and order execution to issue where an inferior judge had neglected
to do so. They had cognizance in matters of tithes, of royal patronage,
patrimony, treasury matters, and jurisdiction; they could even fix the
fee-bill of the ecclesiastical tribunals, settle the estates of bishops, retain
apostolic bulls which they deemed prejudicial to the royal patronage, and
they could watch and regulate the conduct of all ecclesiastical officials. In
making appointments the viceroy was obliged to take the opinion of the
audiencia. Persons aggrieved might appeal from the viceroy to the audiencia.
On the death, absence, or inability of the viceroy the senior oidor
stood in his place. None of these powers were given audiencias in Spain.
This and kindred subjects are treated at great length by Solórzano y Pereira,
who was a noted Spanish jurist, born at Madrid in 1575. He studied at
Salamanca, and in 1609 was appointed by Felipe III. oidor of the audiencia
of Lima. Later he became fiscal and councillor in the <i>Consejo de Hacienda</i>,
the <i>Consejo de Indias</i>, and the <i>Consejo de Castilla</i>. He published several
works on jurisprudence, the most conspicuous being <i>Disquisitiones de
Indiarum jure</i>, 2 vols, folio, Madrid, 1629-39. It was reprinted in 1777, an
edition meanwhile appearing in Lyons in 1672. A Spanish translation by
Valenzuela was published at Madrid in 1648, and reprinted in 1776. I have
used both the Latin edition and the Spanish, but the latter is preferable.</p>

<p class="footnote">
The work is a commentary on the laws of the Indies, wonderfully concise for
a Spanish lawyer of that period, and was of great utility at a time when
those laws were in chaotic condition.

<p class="footnote">
To conclude my remarks on audiencias in America I will only say that
ultimately their number was eleven; and one at Manila, which, like that of
Santo Domingo, had a president, oidores, and a fiscal, and exercised executive
as well as judicial functions. The eleven, including that of Santo Domingo,
were those of Mexico and Lima, each being presided over by a viceroy, and
having 8 oidores, 4 alcaldes del crímen, and 2 fiscales; and those of Guatemala,
Guadalajara, Panamá, Chile, La Plata, Quito, Santa Fé, and Buenos
Ayres. These several audiencias were formed at different times soon after
the establishing of government in the respective places. See further, <i>Montemayor</i>,

of popular writers, having neither the space nor the inclination. It would
seem that in the present, and like instances, of which there are many, the
mistake springs from an easy carelessness which regards the difference of a
year or two in the date of the settlement of an island as of no consequence;
for Las Casas, and other authorities who agree better than usual in this case,
were before Mr Irving at the time he entered in his manuscript the wrong
date. Important and sometimes even unimportant discrepancies of original
or standard authorities will always be carefully noted in these pages. What
I shall endeavor to avoid is captious criticism, and the pointing out of insignificant
errors merely for the satisfaction of proving others in the wrong.

her son Luis, then six years of age, the viceroyalty of Veragua, which was
refused. She then carried her claim to Spain, where the title of admiral was
conferred on Luis, and many other benefits were extended by the emperor to
the family, but the title of viceroy was withheld. Subsequently Luis, having
instituted court proceedings which were referred to an arbitration, succeeded
in having himself declared captain-general of Española. Shortly before his
death he relinquished the claim to the viceroyalty of the New World for the
titles of duke of Veraguas and marquis of Jamaica, and gave his right to a tenth
of the produce of the Indies for a pension of a thousand doubloons. Luis was
succeeded by a nephew, Diego, by whose death the legitimate male line was
extinguished. Then followed more litigation, female claimants now being

executive as well as judicial powers, in permanent session at Madrid, and
having the same jurisdiction over Spanish colonies in America that was held
in Spain by the other supreme councils, especially the <i>Consejo de Castilla</i>.
Immediately after its discovery the American portion of the Spanish realm
was superintended by the Council of Castile, or by councillors selected therefrom.
But with the constantly increasing burden of business the creation
of a separate supreme tribunal became necessary. Thus the machinery set
in motion by Ferdinand was augmented by Charles, and further improved by
Philip, until these vast western interests were watched over with undeviating
care. Thence all measures for the government and commerce of Spanish
America issued; it was the tribunal likewise of ultimate resort where all
questions relating thereto were adjudicated. For many years, however, the
India Council had no formal existence. Fonseca; Hernando de Vega, <i>comendador
mayor</i> of Leon; Mercurino Gatinara, afterward superintendent of all
the councils; a gentleman of the emperor's bedchamber called De Lassao;
Francisco de Vargas, treasurer-general of Castile, and others, acted specially
at the request of their sovereign. This fact gave rise to errors of date into
which several historians fell. Thus Prescott, <i>Ferd. and Isabella</i>, iii. 452, says,
copying Robertson, <i>Hist. Am.</i>, ii. 358, that the Council of the Indies was first
established by Ferdinand in 1511. Helps, <i>Span. Conq.</i>, ii. 28—drawing a false
inference from a false inference drawn by Herrera, ii. ii. xx., who makes the
date 1517—goes on to describe a council for Indian affairs, dating its organization
1518, and of which Fonseca was president, and Vega, Zapata, Peter
Martyr, and Padilla were members.</p>

<p class="footnote">
It was the first of August, 1524, that the office proper of the Council of
the Indies was created. See <i>Solorzano</i>, <i>Politica Indiana</i>, ii. 394. The decree
of final organization may be found in the <i>Recop. de Indias</i>, i. 228.
It sets forth that in view of the great benefits, under divine favor, the
crown daily receives by the enlargement of the realm, the monarch by the
grace of God feeling his obligation to govern these kingdoms well, for the
better service of God and the well-being of those lands, it was ordered
that there should always reside at court this tribunal. It should have
a president; the grand chancellor of the Indies should also be a councillor;
its members, whose number must be eight, should be <i>letrados</i>, men
learned in the law. There were to be a fiscal, two secretaries, and a deputy
grand chancellor, all of noble birth, upright in morals, prudent, and God-fearing
men. There must be, also, three <i>relatores</i>, or readers, and a notary,
all of experience, diligence, and fidelity; four expert <i>contadores de cuentas</i>,
accountants and auditors; a treasurer-general; two <i>solicitadores fiscales</i>,
crown attorneys; a chief chronicler and cosmographer; a professor of
mathematics; a <i>tasador</i> to tax costs of suits; a lawyer and a <i>procurador</i> for
poor suitors; a chaplain to say mass on council days; four door-keepers, and
a bailiff, all taking oath on assuming duty to keep secret the acts of the
council. The first president appointed was Fray García de Loaysa, at the
time general of the Dominicans, confessor of the emperor, and bishop of
Osma, and later cardinal and archbishop of Seville. The first councillors were
Luis Vaca, bishop of the Canary Islands; Gonzalo Maldonado, later bishop
of Ciudad Rodrigo; Diego Beltran; the prothonotary, Pedro Martyr de Anglería,
abbot of Jamaica, and Lorenzo Galindez de Carbajal. Prado was the
first fiscal. A list of the earlier presidents, councillors, and officials may be
found at the end of <i>Descripcion de las Indias Occidentales</i>, in vol. i. Barcia's
edition of Herrera.

<p class="footnote">
The jurisdiction of the council extended to every department, civil, military,
ecclesiastical, and commercial, and no other council in Spain might have
cognizance of any affairs appertaining to the New World. Two thirds of the
members must approve of any law or ordinance before it was presented to the
king for his signature. In the <i>Recopilacion de las Indias</i>, i. 228-323, is given the
legislation on the council to 1680. Philip II. ordered the council to be obeyed
equally in Spain and in the Indies. Three members were to constitute a
quorum, and sit from three to five hours every day except holidays. For
purposes of temporal government the New World was to be divided into
viceroyalties, provinces of audiencias, and <i>chancillerías reales</i>, or sovereign
tribunals of lesser weight than audiencias, and provinces of the officials of
the royal exchequer, <i>adelantamientos</i>, or the government of an adelantado,
<i>gobernaciones</i>, or governmentships, <i>alcaldías mayores</i>, <i>corregimientos</i>, <i>alcaldías
ordinarias</i>, and of the <i>hermandad</i>, <i>concejos de Españoles y de Indios</i>; and for
spiritual government into archbishoprics and suffragan bishoprics, abbeys,
parishes, and <i>diezmerías</i>, or tithing districts, and provinces of the religious
orders. The division for temporal matters was to conform as nearly as possible
to that for spiritual affairs. The council was commanded to have for its
chief care the conversion and good treatment of the Indians. The laws made
by the Council for the Indies should conform as nearly as possible to the existing
laws of Spain. In selecting ecclesiastics and civil officers for the Indies,
the greatest care should be exercised that none but good men were sent, and
their final nomination must rest with the king. Nepotism was strictly prohibited,
and offices were not to be sold. In 1600 Felipe III. ordered that
twice a week should be held a council of war, composed of eight members,
four of whom were councillors of the Indies, and four specially selected by the
king. It was decreed in 1584 that the offices of governors, corregidores,
and alcaldes mayores of the Indies, when bestowed on persons residing in
Spain, should be for five years; when residents in the Indies were appointed,
it should be for three years. Felipe IV. in 1636 ordered that in the archives
of the council, beside records, should be kept manuscripts and printed books
treating on matters moral, religious, historical, political, and scientific, touching
the Indies, all that had been or should be issued; and publishers of books
of this class were required by law to deposit one copy each in these archives.
Two keys were ordered kept, one by the councillor appointed by the president,
and the other by the senior secretary. And when the archives of the
council became too full, a portion might be sent to Simancas. It was
early ordered that the chronicler of the council should write a history, natural
and political, of the Indies, every facility being afforded him; and before
drawing his last quarter's salary each year, he must present what he had
written. So it was with the cosmographer, who was to calculate eclipses, compile
guide-books, prepare tables and descriptions, and give an annual lecture.
The regulations governing this august body were most wise, and it was the constant
aim of the Spanish monarchs to increase its power and sustain its authority.
Its jurisdiction extended over half the world, being absolute on sea and
land. By it viceroys were made and unmade, also presidents and governors;
and, in ecclesiastical rule, patriarchs, archbishops, bishops, and lesser spiritual
dignitaries. His Holiness himself was second here. All bulls or briefs of indulgences
issued by the pope must be laid before the <i>Consejo de Cruzada</i>, and
pass through the Council of the Indies. The Consejo de Indias continued in
Spain till by a law of the Cortes, March 24, 1834, it was abolished, as indeed
was the <i>Consejo de Castilla</i>. The judicial functions of the two were vested in
the <i>Tribunal Supremo de España é Indias</i>; their executive powers in the <i>Consejo
Real de España é Indias</i>, both being created by the same law.

<p class="footnote">
The next most important agency in the management of New World affairs
was the <i>Casa de Contratacion</i>, house or board of trade, supreme in commercial
matters, save only in its subordination to the Consejo de Indias, in common
with every other power below absolute royalty. As before stated, on the return
of Columbus from his first voyage, Fonseca, with two or three assistants,
was appointed to take charge of the business appertaining to the discovery,
the nature or importance of which was then but faintly conceived.
This Indian office or agency was established at Seville, with a branch office in
the form of a custom-house at Cádiz. But before the expiration of the first
decade the New World business had so increased, and the New World dimensions
were so rapidly expanding, that it was found necessary to enlarge the
capabilities and powers of the India Office; hence by decrees of January 20,
and June 5, 1503, was ordered established at Seville the <i>Casa de Contratacion
de las Indias</i>, or India house of trade, that commerce between the mother
country and the Indian colonies might be promoted. The first cédula ordered
the office placed in the arsenal, the second in a building known as the <i>alcazar
viejo</i>, and in that part of it called the <i>cuarto de los almirantes</i>, or admirals'
quarters. The board consisted of a president, three royal officers, or
judges, to wit, treasurer, auditor, and factor; also three judges bred to the
law; one fiscal, and other lesser officers and attendants. Among the first to
serve, beside Fonseca, were Sancho de Matienzo, a canon of Seville, treasurer;
Francisco Pinelo, factor, or general agent; and Jimeno de Berviesca, contador,
or auditor. By law those three officers were to reside in the building; and were
to despatch all ships going to the Indies, and receive all merchandise coming
thence. In all which they were scrupulously to respect the agreement made
with Columbus by the sovereigns. They were, moreover, to proclaim that
licenses for discovery and trade would be given, under just conditions, to all
seeking them and filing commensurate bonds. See <i>Nueva España</i>, <i>Brev.

to despatch vessels under the supervision of the Casa de Contratacion.
The India House was a court of judicature no less than a board of trade; it
had cognizance in all civil, criminal, and commercial questions arising from
the traffic of Spain with the Indies, appeal being to the Council of the Indies.
I will mention a few only of the more important of the many minor orders
regulating this board. The volume and variety of its business rapidly increased
from year to year. In 1510 Diego Colon was instructed to inform
its officers concerning all that he should write to the king. The board was
obliged to possess itself of the minutest knowledge concerning New World
affairs, and of persons asking permission to go thither, and in the execution of
its duties it was not to be interfered with even by royal officers of high rank.
The actual powers conferred on the three officials first named by Queen Juana
are not given by any of the chronicles, or collections of laws, which I have
examined. Indeed, the powers and jurisdiction of the board were never
clearly defined until the issuing of the ordinances of the 23d of August, 1543,
known as the <i>ordenanzas de la casa</i>, and which should not be confounded with
the <i>ordenanzas</i> of other years. Every day but feast-days the board should
meet for business, and remain in session for three hours in the forenoon, and
on the afternoons of Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays for the despatch of
ships. Absence involved primarily loss of pay, and finally loss of office. If
this be not time sufficient for the business, they must take more time. The
president and judges together should transact the business; a judge might
not act singly except upon a matter referred to him by all. The notary should
keep in his book an account of the hours of absence among the officers. Before
the platform on which sat the judges, benches were ordered placed for the convenience
of the <i>visitadores</i>, or inspectors of ships, and such other honorable
persons having business there as should be invited by the tribunal to sit. The
authorities of Seville should not interfere in the trial and punishment of
crimes committed on board ships sailing to and from the Indies. If the penalty
was death or mutilation, the offender was to be tried by the three judges,
members of the board, learned in the law. In the civil suits of private persons,
appertaining to the Indies, litigants were given the option of bringing
their disputes before the judges of the India House, or before the ordinary
justice of Seville. Disputes arising from shipwreck, loss of cargo, and frauds
connected therewith, were all brought before the India House. Traders to
the Indies residing in Seville were authorized to meet and elect a prior and
consul, or consuls, which consulate should be called the <i>Universidad de los
Cargadores á las Indias</i>, and hold their meetings in the Casa de Contratacion.
No foreigner, his son or grandson could so hold office. This consulate had
cognizance in disputes between these merchants and factors in matters relative
to purchases, sales, freights, insurance, and bankruptcy, all being subordinate
to the regular tribunal of the India House. Appeals were from the consulate
to one of the regular judges selected annually to that duty. The consulate
could address the king only through the Casa de Contratacion, and government
despatches from the Indies must be forwarded by the board. As justice alone
was the object of these merchants, and not chicanery, or the distortion of
evidence, parties to suits before the consulate were not allowed lawyers.
That harmony might be maintained, the Casa de Contratacion should carry
out the orders of the <i>audiencia de grados</i> of Seville, if deemed conformable to
law, and to existing regulations of the board. Communications from the
board to the king must be signed by the president and judges conjointly, and
no letter must treat of more than a single subject. All gold, silver, pearls,
and precious stones coming from the Indies were first to be deposited in the
India House, and thence distributed to the owners. The king's share was to
be placed in a safe with three keys, or if this was too small, then in a room
having three keys. Other safes were to be kept, one for each kind of property.
Accounts of receipts at the India House were to be rendered the king
every year. The board must render an annual statement of its expenditures
on <i>religiosos</i> sent to the Indies. Felipe IV. ordered that the board should collect
from all ships and merchandise, including a <i>pro rata</i> on the king's share,
the cost for convoying them forth and back. Such was the famous India House
at Seville, modest in its beginning, mighty in its accomplishments, through
which passed into Spain the almost fabulous wealth of Spanish America.

<p class='footnote' id='FN_V-14'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_V-14'>[V-14]</a></span> <i>Recopilacion de Leyes de los Reynos de las Indias</i>, of which I make general
use in referring to the laws passed in Spain for the regulation of the affairs
of the New World, is the result of several previous efforts in the direction of
compilation. It was published at Madrid, the first edition in four volumes,
by order of Cárlos II. in 1681, and the fourth edition in three volumes,
under the direction of the Royal and Supreme Council of the Indies, in 1791.
The work aimed to embody all laws in force at the date of the respective
editions relative to the Spanish American colonies. The three volumes are
divided into nine books, and each book into from eight to forty-six titles.
The first title of the first book is <i>De la Santa Fe Católica</i>, a subject then
second to none in grave importance. In fact the whole of the first book is
devoted to ecclesiastical and kindred matters. The second book refers in
the main to tribunals and officials; the third in a great measure to the army;
the fourth to discoveries and settlements; the fifth to executive and judicial
offices; the sixth to Indians, including treatment, repartimientos and encomiendas;
the seventh to crimes and punishments; the eighth to the management
of the royal treasury; and the ninth to the India House and the commerce
of the Indies. By a decree of the emperor in 1550, which was
embodied in the ordinances of audiencias in 1563, by Philip II., it was ordered
that all <i>cédulas</i> and <i>provisiones</i> should be copied <i>in extenso</i> in a book set apart
for that service, and of which great care should be taken, and that the said
documents were to be filed chronologically in the archives of each audiencia.
In 1571, by Philip II., it was decreed, and the decree embodied in the <i>Recopilacion</i>
of 1680, that cédulas and provisiones concerning the royal treasury
should be kept in a separate book.</p>

<p class="footnote">
The earliest printed collection of laws relating solely to the Indies is that
of the <i>ordenanzas</i> for the government of the audiencia of Mexico. This was
issued in 1548. In 1552 a similar collection was made by order of the viceroy of
Peru, Antonio de Mendoza, for the government of the audiencia of Lima,
but was not printed at that time. Later the fiscal of Mexico, Antonio Maldonado,
began a compilation to which he gave the name <i>Repertorio de las
Cedulas, Provisiones, i Ordenanzas Reales</i>, but it does not appear that he ever
completed his task, although a royal cédula in 1556 authorized him to do so.
Upon the representation in 1552 by Francisco Hernandez de Liébana, fiscal
of the Council of the Indies, of the urgent necessity of such a work, a royal
cédula was issued in 1560, directing the viceroy of New Spain, Luis de
Velasco, to have prepared and printed such regulations as were in force
within the jurisdiction of the audiencia of Mexico, which was done in 1563
under the direction of Vasco de Puga, oidor of the audiencia. Francisco de
Toledo, sent from Spain in 1569 as viceroy of Peru, was ordered to make a
similar compilation covering the limits of his viceroyalty, but it was afterward
thought better the work should be done in Spain. Hence in 1570
Philip II. ordered made a general compilation of laws and provisions for the
government of the Indies, which was intended as a code, obsolete laws being
omitted, new ones provided where necessary, and those in conflict reconciled.
Of this work, from some cause not satisfactorily explained, probably from
the death of the author, only the title relating to the Consejo de Indias and
its ordenanzas was printed, although the whole of the first book had been
prepared.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
In 1581 some ordinances relative to the Casa de Contratacion and its
judges were printed at Madrid; and more of a similar nature in 1585, beside
the <i>Leyes y Ordenanzas</i> for the government of the Indies, and the ordinances
of 1582 concerning the despatch of fleets for New Spain and Tierra Firme,
printed at Madrid; and in Guatemala the <i>ordenanzas</i> of July 14, 1556, relating
to the <i>Universidad de los Mercaderes de Sevilla</i>. In 1594 the marqués de
Cañete, viceroy of Peru, published at Lima a small volume of ordinances relative
to the good treatment of the Indians. But the want of a general compilation
becoming more and more apparent, Diego de Encinas, a clerk in the
office of the king's secretary, was ordered to prepare a copy of all <i>provisiones</i>,
<i>cédulas</i>, <i>cartas</i>, <i>ordenanzas</i>, and <i>instrucciones</i> despatched prior to 1596, which
work was printed at Madrid, in four folio volumes, the same year. Harrisse
is mistaken when he says these volumes were suppressed, not having been
authorized; for not only is their authorization distinctly stated over the king's
own hand in the enacting clause of the <i>Recopilacion de las Indias</i>, May 18,
1680, where it says that Philip II. ordered Encinas to do this work, but that
owing to their faulty arrangement the volumes 'aun no han satisfecho el intento
de recopilar en forma conveniente,' which clearly shows them to have
been in use up to that time. Shortly after this, Alvar Gomez de Abaunza,
oidor of the audiencia of Guatemala, and subsequently <i>alcalde del crímen</i> of
the audiencia of Mexico, compiled two large volumes under the title of <i>Repertorio
de Cedulas Reales</i>, which were not printed. And in Spain, Diego de Zorrilla
made an attempt to revive the project of the <i>recopilacion de leyes</i>, by
making extracts from Encinas and adding laws of later date; but having received
an appointment as oidor of the audiencia of Quito, he left the work
incomplete and in manuscript. Others made similar attempts; I shall not be
able to enumerate them all, or give a full list even of the printed collections.
For example, in 1603 was published at Valladolid a folio entitled <i>Ordenanças
Reales del Consejo de Indias</i>, and another thin folio called <i>Leyes y Ordenanças
Nuevamente hechas por su Magestad, para la gouernaciõ de las Indias</i>; later
appeared a folio entitled <i>Ordenanças de la Casa de la Contratacion de Sevilla</i>,
and another, <i>Ordenanças Reales para el gobierno de los Tribunales de Contaduría
Mayor en los Reynos de las Indias</i>. In 1606 Hernando de Villagomez began
to arrange cédulas and other laws relating to the Indies; and two years after,
the celebrated conde de Lémos being president of the Council, Villagomez,
and Rodrigo de Aguiar y Acuña, member of the Council of the Indies, were appointed
a committee to compile the laws; but nothing came of it, even Fernando
Carrillo failing to complete their unfinished task. Juan de Solórzano y Pereira,
oidor of the audiencia of Lima, also began a collection of cédulas, and sent
to the Council of the Indies the first book of his contemplated work, with
the titles of the other five books which he intended to compile. In a <i>carta
real</i> he was thanked for what he had done, and charged to continue his labors,
sending each book as prepared to the Council. I have no evidence that he
did so.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
All this time our book was a-building, and indeed for 170 years more. A
complete history of this one work would fill a volume; obviously in a bibliographical
note, even of undue length, only the more prominent agencies and
incidents of its being can be touched upon.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
We come now to the time when Antonio de Leon Pinelo, judge in the
India House, presented to the Council of the Indies the first and second
books, nearly complete, of his <i>Discurso sobre la importancia, forma, y disposicion
de la Recopilacion de Leies de Indias</i>, which was printed in one volume,
folio, in 1623. This was in reality Encinas' work with some cédulas added.
Meanwhile it appears that some direct official work was done on a compilation,
for in 1624 we find the Council instructing Pinelo to enter into relations
with the custodian of the material for the compilation. Pinelo was likewise
authorized to examine the archives of the Council; and for two years he
employed himself continuously in examining some 500 MS. volumes of cédulas,
containing over 300,000 documents. In the law authorizing the <i>Recopilacion
de las Indias</i> of 1680, it is said that in 1622 the task had been entrusted
to Rodrigo de Aguiar y Acuña, probably the custodian referred to. In 1628
it was thought best to print for the use of the Council an epitome of the part
completed; hence appeared the <i>Sumarios de la Recopilacion General de las Leies
de las Indias</i>. Aguiar y Acuña dying, Pinelo worked on alone until 1634, when
the Council approved of what had been done; and in the year following this
indefatigable and learned man had the satisfaction of presenting the completed
<i>Recopilacion de las Indias</i>. To one of the members, Juan de Solórzano y Pereira,
the work was referred, and received his approbation in 1636. More than
half a million of cédulas had been examined and classified during the progress
of this compilation. And yet it was not published; and during the delay it
was becoming obsolete, and new material and partial compilations were being
made both in Spain and in America, some of which were printed in separate
pieces. In 1634 the <i>Ordenanzas de la Junta de Guerra de Indias</i> were published;
in 1646 Juan Diez de la Calle compiled and published for the Council
of the Indies in small quarto a memorial containing some of the cédulas of
the <i>Recopilacion</i>. A useful aid for the study of statistic geography in America
is to be found in the exceedingly rare <i>Memorial y Noticias Sacras y Reales del
Imperio de las Indias Occidentales</i>. By Iuan Diez de la Calle, 1646, sm. 4to,
183 folios. A register for the Spanish colonies, chiefly of state and church
officials, of towns, their wealth and notable objects. Folios 41-132 refer to
the jurisdictions of the audiencias of Mexico, Guadalajara, and Guatemala.
Calle had in the previous year, as assistant chief clerk to the secretary of the
Royal Council of the Indies, presented the work to the king as <i>Memorial
Informatorio al Rey</i>, and in accordance with his approval it had been reprinted
with additions as above. Encouraged hereby he wrote at greater length the
<i>Noticias Sacras i Reales</i> in twelve libros, the publication of which was begun,
but never finished. Puga's work was continued in the form of an <i>Inventario</i> of
the cédulas relating to New Spain issued from 1567-1620, the manuscript being
presented to the secretary of the New Spain department of the Council
of the Indies by Francisco de Párraga, afterward forming part of the Barcia
collection. In 1647 appeared at Seville the <i>Ordenanças Reales, para la Casa de
Contratacion de Sevilla, y para otras cosas de las Indias</i>; in 1658 Pinelo published
at Madrid the <i>Autos, acuerdos y decretos de gobierno del real y supremo
consejo de las Indias</i>. In 1661 there was printed at Madrid a folio entitled
<i>Ordenanzas para remedio de los daños, é inconvenientes que se siguen de los descaminos
i arribadas maliciosas de los Navios que navegan de las Indias Occidentales</i>;
and in 1672 the <i>Norte de la Contratacion de las Indias Occidentales</i> of
Ioseph de Veitia Linage was published at Seville. J. Stevens translated this
last work into English and published it in London in 1702.

<p class="footnote">
The many and long periods of suspended animation of the <i>Recopilacion de
Indias</i>, between its inception and its birth, is no less remarkable a feature in
the history of the work than its multiplicity of origins and collateral affluents.
In 1660 the case was brought before the king, and then referred to
successive committees, in each of which were several members of the
Council, the whole being under the supervision of their successive presidents,
until finally, on the 18th of May, 1680, a royal decree made the
<i>Recopilacion de Indias</i> law, and all ordinances conflicting therewith null.
Even now printing did not seem to be at first thought of. Two authenticated
copies were ordered made, one to be kept in the archives of the Council, and
the other at Simancas. It was soon seen, however, that this was not sufficient,
and in 1681 the king ordered the book printed under the superintendence
of the Council of the Indies, which was done. Although the <i>Recopilacion
de Indias</i> was several times revised, and well fulfilled its mission for over
a hundred years, in fact to the end of Spain's dominion in America, several
partial collections appeared from time to time in Spain and in America.
Among these were <i>Sumarios de las Cédulas ... que se han despachado ... desde
el año 1628 ... hasta ... 1677</i>, printed in Mexico in 1678;
<i>Ordenanzas del
Perù</i>, Lima, 1685; also the <i>Ordenanhas de Cruçada, para los Subdelegados del
Perù</i>;
<i>Reglamento y Aranceles Reales para el Comercio Libre de España à
Indias</i>, 1778;
<i>Teatro de la legislacion universal de España e Indias</i>, by Antonio
Javier Perez y Lopez, 28 vols. 4to, Madrid, 1791-8. In the various
public and private archives of Spain and Spanish America are manuscript
collections of cédulas and compilations on special subjects.

<p class='footnote' id='FN_VI-1'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_VI-1'>[VI-1]</a></span> The world was at a loss at first what to call the newly found region to
the westward. It was easy enough to name the islands, one after another,
as they were discovered, but when the Spaniards reached the continent they
were backward about giving it a general name. Everything was so dark
and uncertain; islands were mistaken for continent, and continent for
islands. The simple expression New World that fell with the first exclamations
of wonder from the lips of Europeans on learning of the success
of Columbus sufficed for a time as a general appellation. More general
and more permanent was the name India, arising from the mistake that
this was the farther side or eastern shore of India, applied at first to the
continent as well as to the islands, and which fastened itself permanently on
the people as well as on the country. 'Segun la opinion mas probable, que
penetró hasta aquellos parages, y tambien mas comunmente se da à este nuevo
mundo descubierto, el nombre de Indias Occidentales, para distinguirlas de
las verdaderas que están situadas en la Asia à nuestro Oriente entre el Indo,
y el Ganges.' <i>Nueva España, Brev. Res.</i>, MS. i. 3. As the coast line of the
continent extended itself and became known as such it was very naturally
called by navigators <i>tierra firme</i>, firm land, in contradistinction to the islands
which were supposed to be less firm. And, indeed, not the islands only, but
the people of the islands are inconstant, the moon being mistress of the
waters. As Las Casas, <i>Hist. Indias</i>, iii. 395, puts it, 'La naturaleza dellos
no les consiente tener perseverancia en la virtud, quier por ser insulares,
que naturalmente tienen ménos constancia, por ser la luna señora de las
aguas.' The name Tierra Firme, thus general at first, in time became particular.
As a designation for an unknown shore it at first implied only the
Continent. As discovery unfolded, and the magnitude of this Firm Land became
better known, new parts of it were designated by new names, and
Tierra Firme became a local appellation in place of a general term. Paria
being first discovered, it fastened itself there; also along the shore to Darien,
Veragua, and on to Costa Rica, where at no well defined point it stopped, so
far as the northern seaboard was concerned, and in due time struck across to
the South Sea, where the name marked off an equivalent coast line. Lopez
Vaz, in <i>Purchas</i>, <i>His Pilgrimes</i>, iv. 1433, says, 'From this Land of Veragua vnto
the Iland of Margereta, the Coast along is called the <i>firme Land</i>, not for that
the other places are not of the firme Land, but because it was the first firme
Land that the Spaniards did conquer after they had past the Ilands.' In the
<i>Recop. de Indias</i>, i. 324, is a law dated 1535, and repeated 1537, 1538, 1563,
1570, 1571, and 1588, which places within the limits of the kingdom of Tierra
Firme the province of Castilla del Oro. As a political division Tierra Firme
had existence for a long time. It comprised the provinces of Darien, Veragua,
and Panamá, which last bore also the name of Tierra Firme as a province.
The extent of the kingdom was 65 leagues in length by 18 at its greatest
breadth, and nine leagues at its smallest width. It was bounded on the east
by Cartagena, and the gulf of Urabá and its river; on the west by Costa Rica,
including a portion of what is now Costa Rica; and on the north and south
by the two seas. On the maps of <i>Novvs Orbis seu descriptionis Indiæ Occidentalis</i>
by De Laet, 1633, and of <i>Ogilby's America</i>, 1671, the Isthmus is called
Tierra Firme. Villagutierre writes in 1701, <i>Hist. Conq. Itza</i>, 12, 'Tierra-Firme
de la Costa de Paria, ò Provincia, que llamò de Veragua; principio
de los dilatados Reynos de aquel Nuevo, y Grande Emisferio.' Neither Guatemala,
Mexico, nor any of the lands to the north were ever included in Tierra
Firme. English authors often apply the Latin form, Terra Firma, to this
division, which is misleading.</p>

<p class="footnote">
The early Spanish writers were filled with disgust by the misnomer America.
Pizarro y Orellana, <i>Varones Ilvstres</i>, in his preface speaks of the 'Nueva,
y riquissima Parte del Mundo, que se llama vulgarmẽte <i>America</i>, y nosotros
llamamos <i>Fer-Isabelica</i>;' and throughout his book the author persists, where
'Nuovo Mundo' is not employed, in calling America Fer-Isabelica, that is to
say Ferdinand and Isabella, an attempt at name-changing no less futile than
bungling. This was in 1639. If with these seventeenth-century writers the
name Columbia, the only appropriate one for the New World, smacked too
strongly of Genoa, they might have called it Pinzonia, which would have
been in better taste, at least, than in bestowing the honor on the cold and
haggling sovereigns. Jules Marcou, like thousands of his class who seek
fame through foolishness, writes in the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>, March, 1875, to prove
that the name America came from a mountain range in Nicaragua, called by
the natives Americ, which became a synonym for the golden mainland, first at
the islands and then in Europe, until it finally reached the foot of the Vosges,
where Waldsee-Müller, or Hylacomylus of Saint Dié, confuses it with the
name of Vespucci, and is led to print in the preface of Vespucci's Voyages:—'And
the fourth part of the world having been discovered by Americus may
well be called Amerige, which is as much as to say, the land of Americus,
or America.' Had the name been so early and so commonly applied to Tierra
Firme, it is strange that some one of the many Spanish writers in the Indies
or in Spain had not employed it or mentioned it. Villagutierre in 1701 endorses
the effort made by Pizarro y Orellana in 1639, saying, <i>Hist. Conq. Itza</i>,
13, that the New World should have been called after the Catholic sovereigns,
'de cuya orden, y à cuyas expensas se descubrian.' He states further, on the
authority of Simon, that the Council of the Indies as late as 1620 talked of
changing the name, but were deterred by the inconvenience involved. Likewise
Vetancurt, <i>Teatro Mex.</i>, 13-15, in 1698 says that the name America
should be erased from history, calling attention to the bull of partition issued
by Pope Adrian VI., which alludes to the new lands as the Western Part—only
it was not Adrian but Alexander VI. who perpetrated the bull, in which
moreover there is no such term as Western Part used—arguing therefrom
that Indias Occidentales was the most proper term. On the application and
origin of the name America see <a href="#Page_123">cap. i. p. 123-5 of this volume</a>.

Bastidas, or by navigators immediately following him. Subsequently the
territory on the eastern side of the gulf was called Urabá, and that on the
western side Darien. On Peter Martyr's map, <i>India beyond the Ganges</i>, 1510,
is the word <i>vraba</i>; on the globe of Orontius, 1531, <i>Sinus vraba</i> is applied to
the gulf, and <i>vrabe</i> to the river Atrato. Pilestrina, <i>Munich Atlas</i>, no. iv.,
1515, places <i>G: d epimeg</i> at the southern end of the gulf, which is represented
as very wide. Maiollo, <i>Munich Atlas</i>, no. v., 1519, writes <i>Vraba</i> in
small letters at the southern end; also the words <i>aldea</i>, <i>tera plana</i>, and <i>Rio
basso</i>.

<p class='footnote' id='FN_VI-3'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_VI-3'>[VI-3]</a></span> Castilla del Oro was for the time but another name for this part of Tierra
Firme. Then Castilla del Oro became a province of Tierra Firme; for in the
<i>Recop. de Indias</i>, ii. 110, we find ordered by the emperor in 1550, 'que la
Provincia de Tierrafirme, llamada Castilla del Oro, sea de las Provincial del
Perú, y no de las de Nueva España.' The province of Veragua, and the territory
'back of the gulf of Urabá, where dwelt the cacique Cimaco,' were
declared within the limits of the government of Tierra Firme. Helps,
<i>Span. Conq.</i>, i. 400, calls a map of that portion of South America extending
from the gulf of Maracaibo to the gulf of Urabá by the name Castilla del
Oro. I have noticed in several of the early maps the same mistake. Colon
and Ribero call only the Pearl Coast Castilla del Oro. In <i>West-Indische
Spieghel</i>, 1624, 64, the country between the Atrato and a river flowing into
the gulf of Venezuela is called Castilla del Oro. Humboldt, <i>Exam. Crit.</i>, i.
320, erroneously narrows the limits of Nicuesa's government to that 'partie
de la Terre-Ferme placée entre le Veragua et le golfe d'Uraba, où commençait
la governacion de Hojeda;' for Navarrete says distinctly in his <i>Noticias
biográficas del capitan Alonso Hojeda</i>, <i>Col. de Viages</i>, iii. 170, 'Los límites de la
gobernacion de Hojeda eran desde el cabo de la Vela hasta la mitad del golfo
de Urabá, que llamaron <i>nueva Andalucía</i>; y los de la gobernacion de Diego
de Nicuesa, que se le concedió al mismo tiempo, desde la otra mitad del golfo
hasta el cabo de <i>Gracias á Dios</i>, que se denominó <i>Castilla del Oro</i>.' He who
some time after drew the commission of Pedrarias Dávila as 'Gobernador de
la provincia de Castilla del Oro en el Darien,' is sadly confused in his New
World geography when he writes, <i>Navarrete</i>, <i>Col. de Viages</i>, iii. 337, 'Una muy
grand parte de tierra que fasta aquí se ha llamado Tierra-firme, é agora mandamos
que se llame Castilla del Oro, y en ella ha hecho nuestra gente un
asiento en el golfo de Urabá, que es en la provincia del Darien, que al presente
se llama la provincia de Andalucía la Nueva, é el pueblo se dice Santa Maria
del Antigua del Darien;' and again on the following page:—'Castilla del Oro,
con tanto que no se entienda ni comprenda en ella la provincia de Verágua,
cuya gobernacion pertenece al Almirante D. Diego Colon por le haber descubierto
el Almirante su padre por su persona, ni la tierra que descubrieron
Vicente Yañez Pinzon é Juan Diaz de Solis, ni la provincia de Pária.' Oviedo
marks the limits plainly enough, iv. 116, 'Por la costa del Norte tiene hasta
Veragua, que lo que con aquel corresponde en la costa del Sur puede ser la
punta de Chame, que está quince leguas al Poniente de Panamá, é desde allí
para arriba seria Castilla del Oro hasta lo que respondiesse ó responde de
Norte á Sur.' The <i>Descripcion Panamá</i>, in <i>Pacheco</i> and <i>Cárdenas</i>, <i>Col. Doc.</i>,
ix. 82, says the official name was <i>Provincia de Castilla del Oro y reino de Tierra
Firme</i>, and so remained till the beginning of the 17th century, and afterward
<i>Bética áurea</i>, or <i>Castilla del oro</i>, is written in <i>Décadas</i>, <i>Pacheco</i> and <i>Cárdenas</i>,
<i>Col. Doc.</i>, viii. 14.

Herrera, dec. i. lib. vii. cap. xi., says that 700 sailed from Española with
Nicuesa and 300 with Ojeda. 'No pudiendo Hojeda por su pobreza aprestar
la expedicion, la Cosa y otros amigos le fletaron una nao, y uno ó dos bergantines,
que con doscientos hombres.' <i>Noticias biográficas del capitan Alonso
Hojeda</i>, <i>Navarrete</i>, <i>Col. de Viages</i>, iii. 170. Benzoni, who pays little heed
to numbers or dates, says, <i>Hist. Mondo Nvovo</i>, 37, 'Hoieda comprò quattro

<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_VI-6'>[VI-6]</a></span> 'Bachiller,' says the English translator of Benzoni, 'has a wider meaning
than our word bachelor, signifying also an inferior order of knighthood.' This
is a mistake. The word has the same corresponding significance in both languages.
It is true that the degree exempts the possessor from certain obligations,
such as personal service, military and municipal, imprisonment for debt,
etc., and grants him certain privileges enjoyed by noblemen. But this does
not make him noble. The next degree, which is that of licentiate, carries with
it still further privileges, but even this does not constitute knighthood. The
degree of doctor, which follows that of licentiate and is the highest conferred
by the university, gives the possessor the right to prefix Don to his name, and
places him in nearly every respect on a par with noblemen.

<p class='footnote' id='FN_VI-7'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_VI-7'>[VI-7]</a></span> The word <i>alcalde</i> is from the Arabic <i>al cadi</i>, the judge or governor. <i>Alcalde
ordinario</i> used formerly to designate the officer having the immediate
superintendency of a town or city, with cognizance of judicial matters except
those of persons enjoying some privilege (<i>fuero</i>). <i>Alcalde mayor</i> signifies a
judge, learned in the law, who exercises ordinary jurisdiction, civil and criminal,
in a town or district. The office is equivalent to that of district judge in
the United States, the audiencia standing for the supreme court. There were,
however, in the early years, alcaldes mayores who were not law judges, or
men learned in the law; they governed for the king a town or city not the
capital of a province.</p>

<p class="footnote">
<i>Corregidor</i>, a magistrate having civil and criminal jurisdiction in the
first instance (<i>nisi prius</i>) and gubernatorial inspection in the political and
economical government in all the towns of the district assigned to him. There
were <i>corregidores letrados</i> (learned in the law), <i>políticos</i> (political), <i>de capa y
espada</i> (cloak and sword), and <i>políticos y militares</i> (holding civil and military
authority). All had equal jurisdiction. When the corregidor or mayor was
not by profession a lawyer, unless he had an <i>asesor</i> of his own, the alcalde
mayor, if possessed of legal knowledge, became his adviser, which greatly
increased the importance of the latter. The alcalde mayor was appointed
by the king. He must be by profession a lawyer, twenty-six years of age,
and of good character. He could neither be a native of the district in which
he was to exercise his functions, nor could he marry a wife in his district.
<i>Recop. de Indias</i>, ii. 113-27 and note. So much for the law. Practically in
cases of this kind, where the governor was not learned in the law, civil,
criminal, and some phases even of military authority devolved on the alcalde
mayor, the two first <i>ex officio</i>, and the last as the legal adviser of the military
chief. In new colonies this officer was invested with powers almost equal to
those of the governor, though of a different kind.

says: 'Començo luego vna fortaleza, y pueblo, donde se recoger, y assegurar
en el mismo lugar que quatro años antes lo auia comẽçado Iuan dela Cosa.
Este fue el primer pueblo de Españoles en la tierra firme de Indias.' If the
author refers his first town to the former visit of Juan de la Cosa four years
before, I should say that could scarcely be called an attempted settlement,
still less an established town. If he intimates that this fort of Ojeda's was
the first settlement, then is he wrong, for Belen, in Veragua, was before this.
Whatever he means, and that often is impossible to determine, in this instance
it is safe to say that he is in error, as San Sebastian can by no possibility
have been the first settlement in Tierra Firme. Herrera writes, i. vii.
xvi.: 'Entrò en el golfo de Vrabà, y buscò el rio del Darien, que entre los
Indios era muy celebrado de oro, y de gente belicosa, y no le hallando, sobre
vnos cerros assentó vn pueblo, al qual llamò la villa de san Sebastian, tomandole
por abogado contra las flechas de la yerua mortifera: y esta fue la segunda
villa de Castellanos que se poblò, en todo la tierra firme, auiendo sido
la primera la que començò a poblar el Almirante viejo, en Veragua.' Words
to the same effect are in <i>Navarrete</i>, <i>Col. de Viages</i>, iii. 172. It seems rather
premature to call these futile attempts establishing towns.

<p class='footnote' id='FN_VI-13'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_VI-13'>[VI-13]</a></span> Chagre, not Chagres, was the name of the native province through
which this river flows. Near its mouth empty several small streams, and it
was only below the confluence of these that the term Lagartos for any length
of time applied. Says Alcedo, <i>Dic.</i>, i., of the River Chagre:—'Lo descubrió
el de 1527 Hernando de la Serna llamándole rio de Lagartos, y antes su boca
Lope de Olano el de 1510.' Oviedo remarks upon it:—'Algunos han querido
deçir que los de aquesta armada le dieron este nombre, porque ninguna cosa
viva saltaba de los navíos que en pressençia de la gente no se la comiessen
luego muy grandes lagartos, lo qual se experimentó en algunos perros. Este
rio es la boca del rio Chagre.' <i>Hist. Gen.</i>, ii. 467. Acosta is somewhat loose
in the statement, <i>Compend. Hist. Nueva Granada</i>, 34, 'En la boca del rio
Chagres, que entonces llamaban de los Lagartos por la multitud de caimanes
que Colon habia visto en él.' Vaz Dourado places, on <i>Munich Atlas</i>, no. x.,
1571, in this vicinity a river with the word <i>chi</i>. <i>Munich Atlas</i> no. ix. has it
<i>Chiche</i>. De Laet writes <i>R. de Chagre</i>; Dampier, <i>R. Chagre</i>; Jefferys, <i>R.
Chagre</i> and <i>Ft. Chagre</i>.
</p>

<p class='footnote' id='FN_VI-14'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_VI-14'>[VI-14]</a></span> The name familiar to cartographers often assumed in those days peculiar
orthography on the maps. Thus Fernando Colon writes this name <i>nõbre</i>; Ribero,
<i>nõb</i>; Agnese, <i>nõmbre de dio</i>; Vaz Dourado, <i>nöbre de dios</i>; Ramusio, <i>Nome
de dio</i>; Hondius, in Purchas, <i>Nom de Dios</i>; Mercator, Dampier, Ogilby, the
author of <i>West-Indische Spieghel</i>, Jefferys, and their successors, contrary to
their frequent custom, all write the words correctly. This place, as we shall
hereafter see, was for a long time famous as the chief post on the northern coast
of Tierra Firme through which passed the merchandise from Spain and the gold
from Peru. Says Benzoni, <i>Hist. Mondo Nvovo</i>, 79: 'Questa Città stà situata
nel mare di Tramontana. Sogliono adunque communemente ogn'anno andare
di Spagna al Nome di Dio, da quattordici, ò quindici naui, fra piccole, e grande,
e la maggior porterà mille, e ottocento salme; cariche di robbe diuerse.' Dampier
about a century later found the spot where the city had stood overgrown
with trees. Its abandonment was owing to poisoned air, the same unwholesome
climate that broke up all the early settlements on this coast, the last
being always regarded as the worst.

has been properly represented as a vain and shallow man is proved by a reference
to his book, <i>Suma de Geographia</i>, 2, wherein he does not hesitate to patronize
the boy-emperor 'whose youth had not permitted him to read much of geography.'

beastly in his bigotry and cruelty as his less learned companions we may
know from what he himself wrote the king, <i>Pacheco</i> and <i>Cárdenas</i>, <i>Col. Doc.</i>,

<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_VII-7'>[VII-7]</a></span> As I have before observed, there were alcaldes of various denominations,
duties, and jurisdictions. In new discoveries, when the chief of the expedition
had not contracted with the king for the appointing of authorities, the
settlers met and elected one or more alcaldes and regidores. The alcalde, in
the absence of the governor or military chief, presided over the municipal
council, composed of regidores who governed the municipality, or <i>regimiento</i>,
as it was then called. The alcalde was also the executive power, exercising
the functions of judge, with original jurisdiction in all matters civil and criminal,
those relating to the natives excepted. In the absence of the adelantado
he was therefore chief in authority, and when the governor was present, the
alcalde was second. Alcaldes in new settlements, and in early times, were
different from those created later. Their duties covered the emergency. In
the present instance, had Enciso continued to exercise the office of alcalde
mayor, regidores might still have been elected to attend to the affairs of the
municipality, in which case no alcaldes would have been elected, for Enciso
himself would have presided.

<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_VII-11'>[VII-11]</a></span> Benzoni asserts that after leaving Antigua, Nicuesa followed the coast
for some distance, but landing one day for water, he was seized by cannibals,
who captured the vessel and devoured the men. 'E cosi Niquesa molto
dolente se ne parti, e per quella costa andando salto in terra per piglior acqua,
e su da paesani ucciso, e poi mangiato con tutti i suoi compagni, e questo
su la fine della vita di Diego di Niquesa, con la sua armata di Veragua.' <i>Hist.
Mondo Nvovo</i>, i. 47. A story was current for a time that they had been
thrown on Cuba, where all perished, leaving inscribed upon a tree, 'Here
ended the unfortunate Nicuesa.' Las Casas and Herrera, however, are of
opinion that his vessel foundered at sea. 'Algunos imaginaron que aportò a
Cuba, y que los Indios le mataron, porque andando ciertos Castellanos por la
isla hallarõ escrito en un arbol: Aqui feneciò el desdichado Nicuesa: pero esto
se tuvo por los hombres mas verdaderos, por falso, porque los primeros que entraron
en Cuba, afermaron nunca aver oydo tal nueva. Lo que se tuvo por mas
cierto, es, que como llenava tan mal navio, y las mares de aquellas partes son ton
bravas, y vehementes, la mesma mar lo tragara facilmente, o que pereceria de
hãbre, y de sed.' <i>Herrera</i>, i. viii. viii. But his fate must forever remain a
mystery; and he one among the many whose visionary hopes have been buried
beneath these waters; one among the many who, having left home with sanguine
expectations, sailed over these seas in quest of gold or adventure, never
again to be heard from! It is easy, after a failure, to find the mistake. Many
of Nicuesa's misfortunes sprang not from any fault, and yet faults, in place of
nobler qualities, were developed by his misfortunes.

<p class='footnote' id='FN_VIII-3'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_VIII-3'>[VIII-3]</a></span> Martin Fernandez de Enciso first came to the Indies with Bastidas. After
practising law for a time successfully at Santo Domingo, he was tempted to
this expedition, as we have seen, by Ojeda, upon the promise of the office of
alcalde mayor. Though a pettifogger in his profession, he was nevertheless
possessed of worth and ability in other directions. In Darien, while in the
main well meaning, he was unable to cope successfully with shrewder intellects
sharpened by New World experiences. After his return to Spain he
published a work, entitled <i>Suma de geografiã q̃ trata de todas las partidas &amp;
prouincias del mundo: en especial de las indias, y trata largamẽte del arte del
marear: Juntamete con la esphera en romãce: con el regimiento del Sol &amp; del
norte: nueuamente hecha</i>. As the title indicates, the book purports to be a
compendium of universal geography, treating of all parts of the world, but
including the little that was then known of the Indies. That part relating
to the New World was made up in a great measure from his own observations.
And yet it resembles too nearly the usual summaries of the period to be of
much value. The first third of the work is devoted to the science of geography,
with astronomical tables and a résumé of early Spanish history. Then
the physical features of Spain, and Europe generally, are given, and finally a
rambling account of Asia, Africa, and America. It was printed at Seville by a
German, Jakob Cromberger, in 1519. Other editions appeared in 1530 and 1546.
My edition is dated 1530, the part relating to America occupying the last eight
folios of the book. Bibliographers believe this the first book relative to the New
World printed in the Spanish language. 'Livre curieux, parce qu'il est le
premièr traité de géographie impr. en Espagne, où l'on trouve des détails sur
l'Amérique.' <i>Brunet</i>, <i>Manuel du Libraire</i>. 'Apparently the first book printed in
Spanish relating to America.' <i>Rich</i>, <i>Bibliotheca Americana Vetus</i>. 'L'ouvrage
rare et très remarquable.' <i>Humboldt</i>, <i>Examen Critique</i>, iv. 306. 'A great hydrographer
and explorer, his work is invaluable for the early geographical history
of the continent.' <i>Harrisse</i>, <i>Bibliotheca Americana Vetustissima</i>. Navarrete says:
'Escribió Enciso un papel muy curioso sobre si los conquistadores españoles
podian tener y poseer indios encomendados, contra los frailes dominicos que
decian que no, y se opusieron al despacho de la expedicion de Pedrarias Dávila,
so pretexto de que el Rey no podia enviar á hacer tales conquistas.'
And in his <i>Epitome</i>, Pinelo remarks: 'Trata en su <i>Suma Geografia</i> del Arte
de Navegar, de la Esfera, y de las quatro partes del Mundo, especialmente de
las Indias, i es el primero que imprimió <i>Obra Geografica</i> de ellas.' Indeed, this
last was said in 1738, and subsequent bibliographers have repeated it.

some country villages where jails were not built, it was customary to construct
a small enclosure on the plaza near the <i>casa consistorial</i>, or municipal
hall, in which to confine prisoners till sent to the capital of the province,
or elsewhere, for trial. Those convicted of petty municipal offences were
likewise incarcerated in this pen. Inside were stocks, the better to secure
great offenders.

<p class='footnote' id='FN_VIII-6'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_VIII-6'>[VIII-6]</a></span> In popular parlance, <i>acogerse á santuario</i>, or <i>acogerse á sagrado</i>, or <i>tomar
iglesia</i>, the protection afforded criminals who sought refuge in a church or other
sacred asylum. As we shall often meet with the custom in this history I will
state briefly what it was. It is well known that from the earliest times, in both
heathen and Jewish societies, the right of asylum, or right of sanctuary, has existed,
in degrees more or less modified by time, down to the present day. In
Spanish-America it was in vogue as late as a quarter of a century ago. Originally
the idea implied the right of appeal from the judgment of men to the
justice of God. The Creator himself, it is said, set the example by placing
a mark on Cain, the first murderer, that none might kill him; and Moses and
Joshua, under divine sanction, established cities of refuge, whither certain
involuntary offenders might flee and find safety. Later, the founders of cities
offered asylum to outlaws for the purpose of increasing the population. To
this custom is attributed in a measure the existence, or at least the importance,
of Athens, Thebes, and other cities. Instead of making the whole city an
asylum, a certain locality was sometimes assigned for that purpose; thus tradition
says that one of the first acts of Romulus preparatory to building his
city was to set apart Palatine Hill as a place of refuge. Sacred groves were
asylums; also temples to the gods, and religious houses. Notably the groves
of the Grecians, and the Erechtheium of Athens, the temple of Artemis at
Ephesus, and that of Apollon at Miletus. With the advent of Christianity,
to increase their influence, the clergy secured this privilege for their
churches. In the time of Constantine all Christian churches afforded refuge,
and Theodosius II. included in this right all houses belonging to the church,
with their courts and gardens. In France and Spain not only the church and
its surroundings afforded protection, but all chapels, cloisters, abbeys, monasteries,
cemeteries, tombs, crosses, and in short all religious monuments.
Frequently a stone bench, called the stone of peace, was placed for refugees
within the church near the altar. The priests assured the people that they
would be visited by dire calamities if they violated this right. Gradually,
however, the practice diminished. Though the culprit must not be forcibly
dragged from the church, he might be enticed thence, or starved out, or smoked
out. Then the more abhorred criminals, as heretics and murderers, were denied
protection; and the number of places was reduced. Clement XIV., in
1772, limited the number to one or two in each town, though no one sheltered
by the roof of a church might be torn thence without an order from the
ecclesiastical judge. The right of churches to extend protection over minor
offenders was recognized long after it became the custom for the clergy to
deliver rank offenders for punishment. The superstition was respected, as
we have seen, in the wilds of the New World by the distempered colonists of
Darien. Nor was England free from it; to this day there are places in France,
and in Scotland, Holyrood abbey and palace, where a debtor may not be arrested.
For a good treatise on right of sanctuary, and on immunity of religious
persons and places, see <i>Vazquez</i>, <i>Chronica de Gvat.</i>, 288 et seq.

gold. In the words of his quaint English translator:—'This pound of eight
ounces, the Spanyardes call Marcha, whiche in weight amounteth to fiftie
pieces of golde called Castellani, but the Castilians call a pound Pesum. We
conclude therefore, that the summe hereof, was xv. thousande of those peeces
of gold called Castellani. And thus is it apparent by this accompt, that they
receiued of the barbarous kings a thousande and fyue hundred poundes, of
eight ounces to the pounde: all the whiche they founde readie wrought in

provinces frequently called by the name of the ruling chief. For instance,
adventurers and geographers who knew only the chief's name, called his village
Careta's village, or Careta; his country, Careta's country, or Careta.
Maiollo, 1519, writes on his map, where the province of Careta should be, <i>aldea
de machin</i>; and adjacent north-west, <i>P. scatozes</i>. Vaz Dourado, <i>Munich Atlas</i>,

Redes, from the snares or nets found there for taking wild beasts; one the Rio
Negro, from the color of its water. Often the Spaniards had scoured these

<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_IX-2'>[IX-2]</a></span> The Spaniards must have had quite accurate information from the natives as
to the trend of the southern coast, though there was then little communication
between the northern and southern seaboards. But, without such knowledge,
Balboa naturally would have undertaken the ascent of the river Atrato,
which flows directly from the south, rather than have sailed some distance to
the north-west before attempting to cross. The direct march to the gulf
of San Miguel, from which course a deviation would have almost doubled the
distance, is another evidence of his having obtained the most reliable information
before or during the march.

<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_IX-3'>[IX-3]</a></span> Enciso, <i>Suma de Geographia</i>, 57, calls the country 'tierra rasa y buena
de muchos mãtenimientos y caças.' 'Experience had proved that moving
a body of men sufficient to act as a protecting force and to carry the
necessary provisions was attended with great risk and great delay.' <i>Gisborne's
Survey of Darien</i>, in <i>London Geog. Soc., Jour.</i>, xxvii. 193. 'Mr Hopkins was
lately prevented by the Indians from ascending the Chepo river towards
Mandinga, or San Blas Bay; and Dr Cullen was stopped likewise by the aborigines
while endeavoring to ascend the Paya river.... <i>Climate</i> and <i>natives</i> are
at present the only serious impediments to a regular survey.' <i>Fitz-Roy's Isth.
Cent. Am.</i>, in <i>London Geog. Soc., Jour.</i>, xx. 161. 'The Panama railroad, a most
stupendous work, considering the excessively swampy nature of the country
over which it has been carried.' <i>Cullen's Darien</i>, 95. For obstacles overcome in
surveying and constructing the Panamá railway, see <i>Otis' Isthmus Panama</i>,
15-36. The climate inclines 'to the wet extreme, for two thirds of the year,
the Rains beginning in <i>April</i>.' <i>Defence of the Scots Settlement at Darien</i>, 64.
On the Atrato 'the trees approach to the very edge of the stream, which their
branches overhang. The trees are frequently concealed by dense masses of
vines which entirely envelope them, and in certain lights present plays of color
comparable only to those of the richest velvet.... But like the plumes and
velvet of the funeral pageant, they serve but to conceal and adorn corruption.
Behind them stretches, far away, the pestiferous swamp, through the
dreary wilds of which even the birds refuse to sport; and whose silence is
broken only by the sighing of the breeze, or the sullen growl of the roving
tiger. Venomous reptiles often fall into the boats from the branches overhead;
wasps' nests are frequent and troublesome; natural levees of soft mud stretch
along the banks. Floods are common, and the houses are built on stilts.'
<i>Trautwine</i>, in <i>Franklin Inst., Jour.</i>, xxvii. 220-4. In 1853, Carl Scherzer, a
German naturalist, travelling in Costa Rica with a civil engineer and a force of
thirty-two men, attempted to make a survey for a road from Angostura to
Limon Bay; but on account of scarcity of provisions, illness, and the difficulties
of the route, they failed in their purpose; and after having penetrated
to within eight leagues of their destination, they were obliged to return,
having travelled only ten leagues in two weeks. See <i>Wagner and Scherzer</i>,
<i>Costa Rica</i>, 358-407. In December of the same year, a party under J.
C. Prevost, of H. M. S. <i>Virago</i>, set out with fourteen days' provisions from
the gulf of San Miguel for Caledonia Bay, on the opposite side of the Isthmus.
Their route was essentially that of Vasco Nuñez on his return. As he ascended
the Sabana River, the attention of Captain Prevost was attracted by
the débris on the overhanging branches, which marked the height of water
attained during certain seasons. The dense foliage was enlivened by birds
of gay plumage; brilliant flowers carpeted the ground; and the chattering
monkeys, which they shot in great numbers, furnished the guides food.
The country even then was as wild as when traversed by Vasco Nuñez;
the natives, however, had exchanged their wooden weapons for fire-arms.
Swamps and hills alternate, and 'dense was the forest we had cut our way
through.' The flora then changed, and 'instead of the small underwood, we
came on almost impenetrable thickets of the prickly palm or aloe, rather
more than six feet in height, through which we with great difficulty cut our
way.' They crossed 'deep ravines, whose steep and slippery sides caused
many a tumble.' The attempt was finally abandoned. Returning, on arriving
at one of their ranchos or encampments, where had been left three sailors
to guard the provisions, they found the men murdered and the camp sacked.
'So toilsome was our journey,' says Captain Prevost, 'that we spent fifteen
days in performing a distance of little more than twenty-six miles, having to
force our slow and laborious path through forests that seemed to stretch from
the Pacific to the Atlantic shores. The trees, of stupendous size, were matted
with creepers and parasitical vines, which hung in festoons from tree to
tree, forming an almost impenetrable net-work, and obliging us to hew open a
passage with our axes every step we advanced.' <i>London Geog. Soc., Jour.</i>,
xxiv. 249. Nothing could more aptly illustrate the difficulties surmounted
by the Spaniards than this narrative of failure, by a British officer of the
nineteenth century, who operated under conditions far more favorable than
those so successfully overcome by a company of ill-accoutred and poorly fed
adventurers more than three hundred years before. With the material before
me, these illustrations could be greatly multiplied; but I have given enough to
show that the transit of the Isthmus, by a small party of Europeans, over an
unknown or unexplored route, is even to-day esteemed a desperate undertaking.

of the commander, whose pedigree and physical and metaphysical traits and
mighty deeds are minutely recorded by contemporary historians. His name
was Leoncico, little lion, descendant of Becerrico, of the Island of San Juan.
He was in color red with black snout, of medium size and extraordinary
strength. In their foragings Leoncico counted as one man, and drew captain's
pay and share of spoils. Upon these conditions his master frequently loaned
him; and during the wars of Darien he gained for Vasco Nuñez more than one
thousand pesos de oro. He was considered more efficient than the best soldier,
and the savages stood in the greatest terror of him. He readily discriminated
between wild and tame Indians. When a captive was missing from the fields,
and Leoncico was told, 'He is gone; seek him!' the dog tracked the poor fugitive,
and did not harm him if he returned quietly, but if the Indian resisted,
the dog would destroy him. The hero of many a conflict, he was covered with
wounds; but like Cæsar he escaped the wars to meet his death by treacherous
hands. He was poisoned. See <i>Oviedo</i>, iii. 9-10.

é quinientos y trece, á las diez horas del dia,' at 10 o'clock in the morning.
So Gomara also writes, <i>Hist. Ind.</i>, 77: 'Vio Valboa ala mar del Sur a los veynte
y cinco del Setiembre del año de treze;' and Las Casas, <i>Hist. Ind.</i>, iv. 109:
'Llegaron á la cumbre de las más altas sierras á 25 dias de Setiembre de dicho
año de 1513;' and Herrera, i. x. i.: 'A veynte y cinco de Setiembre, deste año,
de donde la mar se parecia.' Careful writers following these first authorities
also name the day correctly, as Humboldt, <i>Exam. Crit.</i>, i. 319, who says:
'Vasco Nuñez de Balboa vit la Mer du Sud, le 25 septembre 1513, du haut
de la Sierra de Quarequa;' and Acosta, <i>Compend. Hist. Nueva Granada</i>,
50: 'Esto pasó el dia 25 de setiembre del año de 1513 poco antes de medio dia
y forma una de las épocas notables en el descubrimiento de la América;' and
Quintana, <i>Vidas de Españoles Célebres</i>, 'Balboa,' 20: '25 de setiembre;' and
Chevalier, <i>L'Isthme de Panama</i>, 15: 'Le vingt-cinquième jour, le 25 septembre;'
and Campbell, <i>Hist. Span. Am.</i>, 23: 'the 25th of <i>Septembre</i>;' and
Helps, <i>Span. Conq.</i>, i. 361: '25th of September;' etc. In the face of which,
Irving, <i>Columbus</i>, iii. 198, shows gross carelessness when he writes 'the
26th of September.' To support him he has Ramusio, who, <i>Viaggi</i>, iii.
29, falls into a mistake of Peter Martyr's, 'alli ventisei adunque di Settembre,'
and Du Perier, <i>Cen. Hist. Voy.</i>, 139, and, to copy his error, Dalton, <i>Conq.
Mex. and Peru</i>, 43, and a host of others. Not quite so often mentioned as
Columbus' voyages is this discovery of Vasco Nuñez, though nearly so. After
Oviedo and Las Casas probably Peter Martyr gives the best original account.

<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_IX-10'>[IX-10]</a></span> The form of taking possession, or the declaration of proprietary rights to
the lands seized by Europeans, as we have seen, differs with different discoverers,
and with the same discoverer at different times. Sometimes mass was
said; sometimes a cross was erected; sometimes prayer was offered, of which
the following is said to have been the prescribed form used by Columbus,
Vasco Nuñez, Cortés, and Pizarro: Domine Deus æterne et omnipotens,
sacro tuo verbo cœlum, et terram, et mare creâsti; benedicatur et glorificetur
nomen tuum, laudetur tua majestas, quæ dignita est per humilem servum
tuum, ut ejus sacrum nomen agnoscatur, et prædicetur in hac altera mundi
parte. But always this seizure, whether by Spanish, English, French, or
Dutch, and by whatsoever other formalities attended, was accompanied
by a loud proclamation, before God and man, of the deed then and there consummated.
This proclamation was made with drawn sword, by the commander
of the party taking possession, and sometimes attended by the throwing of
earth toward the four cardinal points, as was common, and is now in Spanish
America, in giving judicial possession in granting lands, and planting the royal
standard. All present were called upon to witness the act, which was done
for and in the name of the sovereign authority recognized by the party.
Then the notary, or, if none were present, a clerk, or a person or persons appointed
to act as such, took down in writing what had been done, and each
member of the party signed it. Examples might be multiplied indefinitely.
We have seen what Columbus did in one or two instances, and how Vasco
Nuñez conducted himself on the mountain overlooking Panamá Bay. That
which I have just given in the text is a literal translation of Balboa's
address to the four corners of the Pacific Ocean as reported by <i>Oviedo</i>,
iii. 11-12. At the beginning the meaning of the orator is clear enough, but
toward the latter part he lapses into verbiage. It is likely that he had in view,
while taking possession of that sea or so much of it as his sovereigns should at
any future time please to claim, the papal bull which divided the heathen
world between Spain and Portugal, and a desire to avoid all words and acts
which might prejudice the Spanish claim. A lengthy account is given of the
taking possession of the province of Paque, on the Pacific shore of the Isthmus,
west of Panamá, in 1519, by Pedrarias Dávila. The party was standing at
the head of an inlet, two notaries, a clergyman, several captains, soldiers, and
seamen, beside the commander, being present. First, Pedrarias called on the
notaries and all present to witness the acts he was about to perform. Then
he took in his right hand a white silk flag, on which was represented the
image of the Virgin Mary, and holding it aloft all knelt; the trumpet sounded,
and in loud tones the commander offered the following prayer: 'Oh! mother
of God, quiet the sea, and render us worthy of being and of moving under thy
protection. May it please thee that under it we may discover these seas, and
lands of the southern sea, and convert the people thereof to our holy Catholic
faith.' Following the prayer was a long speech by Pedrarias, declaring possession
after the usual form, similar to that employed by Vasco Nuñez, interspersed
with divers acts in consummation of what he said. He declared the
possession previously taken renewed, especially the 'possession <i>vel casi</i> of all
the coast of the new land and of the southern sea, and of all the ports and inlets
and coves and roadsteads ... being as I am, in the name of their highnesses
and as their lieutenant-general in the said coast of the said southern sea,
from the stones of the rivers to the leaves of the forests, eating the grass and
drinking the waters, and razing, devastating, and cutting the woods of the said
coast, upon the said site and province of Paque.' As a token of possession and
seizure thereof, civilly, naturally, and bodily, he continued: 'I raise this
royal standard of the said Queen Doña Juana and King Don Cárlos, her son,
our lords, which is of red damask having thereon painted and stamped the
royal arms of their highnesses the said kings, our lords;' the trumpeters were
then ordered to sound; after which, in concert with Pedrarias, all said, 'Castilla
del Oro and Tierra Firme, and new land, and southern sea, and coasts
thereof, and island and islands, and all land and provinces that may be
therein, for the most high and most illustrious Queen Doña Juana, our lady,
and the King Don Cárlos, her son, our lord; and after them for their successors
to Castile.' 'All of which new lands and southern sea and coast thereof and
the whole Tierra Firme and kingdoms of Castilla del Oro, and all thereunto
annexed and appertaining, and all that has been or may be hereafter discovered
therein, is and must be of the royal crown of Castile, and you must testify
how I, Pedrarias Dávila, in the name of the said kings, our lords, and of
their successors to the royal crown of Castile, cut trees, and mow the grass in
said land, and enter the water of the said southern sea, corporeally and standing
on my feet therein, and stamp the new land and waters of the said
southern sea.' Again the trumpets were sounded, and again Pedrarias reiterated
in a loud voice his claims; and he called upon the notaries to witness as
further proof of their possession that four ships had been built and navigated
on the southern sea. Another flourish of trumpets, and by way of doxology
three times repeated, 'Viva la muy alta é muy poderosa reyna doña
Juana,' etc., concluded the ceremony. <i>Testimonio de un acto de posesion que
tomó el Gobernador Pedrárias Dávila</i>, in <i>Pacheco</i> and <i>Cárdenas</i>, <i>Col. Doc.</i>, ii.
549-56. Although the custom was universal from the beginning, Philip II.
deemed best to decree, in 1568, that all captains or others discovering any

applied to any part of the ocean; and for a long time after parts only of it were
so termed, this part of it retained the original name of South Sea, so called because
it lay to the south of its discoverer. The lettering of the early maps is
here significant. All along from this time to the middle of the seventeenth
century, the larger part of the Pacific was labeled <i>Oceanus Indicus Orientalis</i>,
or <i>Mar del Sur</i>, the Atlantic, opposite the Isthmus, being called <i>Mar del
Norte</i>. Sometimes the reporters called the South Sea <i>La Otra Mar</i>, in contradistinction
to the <i>Mare Oceanus</i> of Juan de la Cosa, or the <i>Oceanus Occidentalis</i>
of Ptolemy, as the Atlantic was then called. Indeed, the Atlantic was
not generally known by that name for some time yet. Schöner, in 1520,
terms it, as does Ptolemy in 1513, <i>Oceanus Occidentalis</i>; Grynæus, in 1532,
<i>Oceanus Magnus</i>; Apianus, appearing in the Cosmography of 1575, although
thought to have been drawn in 1520, <i>Mar Atlicum</i>. Robert Thorne, 1527,
in <i>Hakluyt's Voy.</i>, writes <i>Oceanus Occiden.</i>; Bordone, 1528, <i>Mare Occidentale</i>;
Ptolemy, 1530, <i>Occean Occidentalis</i>; Ramusio, 1565, <i>Viaggi</i>, iii. 455, off Central
America, <i>Mar del Nort</i>, and in the great ocean, both north and south, <i>Mar
Ociano</i>; Mercator, 1569, north of the tropic of cancer, <i>Oceanius Atlanticvs</i>;

1671, <i>Oceanus Atlanticum</i>, <i>Mar del Norte</i>, and <i>Oceanus Æthiopicus</i>; Dampier,
1699, <i>the North or Atlantick Sea</i>. The Portuguese map of 1518, <i>Munich
Atlas</i>, iv., is the first upon which I have seen a name applied to the Pacific;
and there it is given, as I have elsewhere remarked, as <i>Mar visto pelos Castelhanos</i>,
Sea seen by the Spaniards. On the maps of Baptiste Agnese, Vallard
de Dieppe, Diego Homem, and others, is the name <i>Mar del Sur</i>, but the lettering
is small, and seems applied only to the waters between Peru and Guatemala.
We have noticed on the globe of Martin Behaim, 1492, a multitude
of islands, scattered and in groups, situated between the coast lines of western
Europe and eastern Asia. In that part of the globe where the north Pacific
Ocean should be represented, are the words <i>Oceanus orientalis Indie</i>. On the
globe of Johann Schöner, 1520, the two continents of America are represented
with a strait dividing them at the Isthmus. The great island of <i>Zipangri</i>, or
Japan, lies about midway between North America and Asia. North of this
island, and in about the same locality as on the globe of Behaim, are the
words <i>Orientalis Oceanus</i>, and to the same ocean south of the equator the
words <i>Oceanus Orientalis Indicus</i> are applied. Diego Homem, in 1558, marks
out upon his map a large body of water to the north-west of <i>Terra de Florida</i>,
and west of Canada, and labels it <i>Mare leparamantium</i>. Neither Maiollo nor
Vaz Dourado gives a name to either ocean. Colon and Ribero call the South
Sea <i>Mar del Svr</i>. In <i>Hakluyt's Voy.</i> we find that Robert Thorne, in 1527,
wrote <i>Mare Australe</i>. Ptolemy, in 1530, places near the Straits of Magellan
<i>Mare pacificum</i>. Ramusio, 1565, <i>Viaggi</i>, iii. 455, off Central America, places
<i>Mar del Sur</i>, and off the Straits of Magellan, <i>Mar Oceano</i>. Mercator places
in his atlas of 1569 plainly, near the Straits of Magellan, <i>El Mar Pacifico</i>,
and in the great sea off Central America <i>Mar del Zur</i>. On the map of
Hondius, about 1595, in <i>Drake's World Encompassed</i>, the general term <i>Mare
Pacificvm</i> is applied to the Pacific Ocean, the words being in large letters extending
across the ocean opposite Central America, while under it in smaller
letters is <i>Mar del Sur</i>. This clearly restricts the name South Sea to a narrow
locality, even at this date. In Hondius' Map, <i>Purchas</i>, <i>His Pilgrimes</i>,
iv. 857, the south Pacific is called <i>Mare Pacificum</i>, and the central Pacific
<i>Mar del Sur</i>.

<p class='footnote' id='FN_X-16'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_X-16'>[X-16]</a></span> From the most high and mighty Catholic defender of the Church, always
triumphant and never vanquished, the great King Don Fernando, the fifth of
that name, King of the Spains, of the two Sicilies, and of Jerusalem, and of
the Indies, isles and firm land of the ocean sea, tamer of barbarous peoples;
and from the very high and puissant lady, the Queen Doña Juana, his dearest
and most beloved daughter, our sovereigns; I, Pedrarias Dávila, their servant,
messenger, and captain, notify and make known to you as best I can, that
God, our Lord, one and triune, created the heavens and the earth, and one man
and one woman, from whom you and we and all mankind were and are
descended and procreated, and all those who shall come after us. But from
the multitudes issuing out of that generation during the five thousand and
more years since the world was made, it became necessary that some should
go one way and some another, dispersing over many kingdoms and provinces,
as in one alone they could not sustain nor preserve themselves.</p>

<p class="footnote">
All these peoples God, our Lord, gave in charge to one person, called Saint
Peter, that he should be prince, lord, and superior over all men in the world,
whom all should obey, and that he should be the head of all the human
lineage, wheresoever man might live or be, and of whatever law, sect, or
belief; and to him is given the whole world for his kingdom and lordship and
jurisdiction. And although he was ordered to place his chair in Rome, as the
most suitable spot whence to rule the world, yet was he also permitted to be
and place his chair in any other part of the world, and judge and govern all
peoples, Christians, and Moors, and Jews, and Gentiles, of whatever sect
or belief they might be. And him they called Pope, that is to say, Admirable,
Supreme, Father, and Keeper, because he is father and keeper of all
men. And this Saint Peter was obeyed and held in reverence as lord, and
king, supreme in the universe, by those who lived in that time, likewise
others who after him were elected to the pontificate were so esteemed, and so
it has continued until now and will continue to the end of the world.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
One of the pontiffs who succeeded as prince and lord of the world, to the
chair and dignity aforesaid, made a donation of these isles and firm land of the
ocean sea to the said King and Queen, our sovereigns, and to their successors,
with all therein contained, as it appears in certain writings made therefor,
which you can see if desirable. So that by virtue of said donation their
highnesses are kings and lords of these isles and firm land, and as such
have been recognized, and obeyed, and served by the inhabitants of almost
all the islands to whom notification has been made, who still obey and
serve them as subjects should; and of their free will, without resistance,
immediately, without delay, as soon as informed of the aforesaid, they obeyed
and recognized the learned men and friars who were sent by their highnesses
to preach and teach our holy Catholic faith; doing this of their free and spontaneous
will, without pressure or condition of any kind; and they became
Christians and are now, and their highnesses received them gladly and benignantly,
and ordered that they should be treated in every respect as their own
subjects and vassals; and you are held and obliged to do likewise. Therefore,
as best I may, I pray and require you well to understand what I have told
you; to take the time which may be necessary to comprehend it and to deliberate
upon it; and to recognize the Church as Supreme Mistress of the Universe, and
the Supreme Pontiff, called Pope, and the King and Queen in his place as monarchs
and supreme sovereigns of these isles and firm land, by virtue of the
donation aforesaid, and to consent and allow these religious fathers to explain
and preach to you as aforesaid. If thus you do, you will do well, and do that
which you are held and bound to do, and their highnesses, and I in their name,
will receive you with all love and charity; and your wives, and children,
and property will be freely left to you without lien, that you may do with
them and with yourselves, whatever you may please. You will not be compelled
to turn Christians, except when informed of the truth you desire to
be converted to our holy Catholic faith, like almost all the inhabitants of
the other isles. And besides this their highnesses will grant you many
privileges and exemptions, and do you many favors. But if you do not
thus, or maliciously delay to do it, I certify to you that with the help of
God I will invade your lands with a powerful force, and will make war upon
you in all parts, and in every manner in my power, and will subject you to
the yoke and obedience of the Church and their highnesses; and I will take
your persons, and those of your wives and children, and will make them
slaves, and as such will sell them and dispose of them as their highnesses
shall order; and I will take your property, and I will do you all possible harm
and evil, as to vassals who do not obey or recognize their lord, but who resist
and oppose him. And I protest that the deaths and damage which from such
conduct may result will be at your charge and not at that of their highnesses, nor
at mine, nor at that of the gentlemen who come with me. And now to that which
I have said I require the notary here present to give me a certificate. Episcopus
Palentinus, comes; F. Bernardus, Trinopolitanus episcopus; F. Thomas de Matienzo;

to the savages in America. The place was the port of Cenú; and when
the lawyer had finished, the chief, whose name was Catarapa, and his people
laughed at him; these benighted barbarians laughed at the learned bachiller,
and said that the Pope must have been drunk when he did it, for he was giving
what was not his; and that the King who asked and took such a grant
must be a crazy one, since he asked for what was another's. 'Dixeron q̃ el
papa deuiera estar borracho quãdo lo hizo; pues daualo q̃ no era suyo, y q̃ el
rey q̃ pedia &amp; tomaua tal merced deuia ser algun loco pues pedia lo que era &amp; de

(Santa Cruz) north and west of Comagre; although Oviedo, iii. 37, says, 'el
puerto de Sancta Cruz que es en tierra del caçique Comogre.' It is often impossible
to reconcile the self-contradictions of a writer, to say nothing of the
conflicting statements of the several chroniclers. Oviedo usually places the
native towns and provinces where most convenient for his narrative.

<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_X-18'>[X-18]</a></span> I do not know that it is necessary here to catalogue Ayora's crimes.
One which the Licenciado Zuazo mentions, <i>Pacheco</i> and <i>Cárdenas</i>, <i>Col. Doc.</i>,
i. 315-16, if sufficiently pluralized, will answer for all. Met one day, on approaching
a village, by natives bearing presents of venison, fowl and fish,
wine and maize, who thought the white tiba to be their friend, Vasco Nuñez,
Ayora seized the cacique and his chief men, tortured them with fire and dogs
until all their gold was given up, and then burned them alive. 'This infernal
hunt lasted several months,' says Oviedo.

Pedrarias sent a ship after Ayora to Santo Domingo, but before it reached that
port Ayora had sailed for Spain, where, soon afterward, he died, leaving the
bishop, the alcalde mayor, and the governor responsible for his crimes. Even

<p class='footnote' id='FN_X-29'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_X-29'>[X-29]</a></span> Writing the king, Vasco Nuñez tells the tale somewhat differently. 'No
sooner had they arrived at Isla Rica,' he says, 'than entering a village they
captured all the Indians they could. The cacique prepared for war, but retired
for several days, during which time the Christians burned half the houses with
all the provisions. Afterward the cacique peaceably returned with fifteen or
sixteen marks of pearls and four thousand pesos in gold. Then he took the
Spaniards to the place where they obtained the pearls, and made his people
gather them, and remain at peace. Notwithstanding all this the captain
without conscience gave away as slaves all the men and all the women whom
he brought away from the Rich Island.' The statement may be taken with
allowance as from a man smarting under wrong; and it is not a little amusing
to see how suddenly tender becomes the conscience of the ingenuous Vasco,
who never stole anything from the natives, or burned their houses, or made
them slaves!

<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_X-31'>[X-31]</a></span> Some of the pearls were of extraordinary size and beauty. One, in particular,
attained no small celebrity. It was pear-shaped, one inch in length,
and nine lines in its largest diameter. Vasco Nuñez describes it as weighing
'ten tomines'—a <i>tomin</i> is about one third of a drachm—'very perfect, without
a scratch or stain and of a very pretty color and lustre and make; which,
in truth,' artlessly intimating what would be his course under the circumstances,
'is a jewel well worthy of presentation to your Majesty, more particularly
as coming from these parts. It was put up at auction and sold for
1,200 pesos de oro to a merchant, and finally fell into the hands of the governor.'
Oviedo, iii. 49, says it weighed 31 carats. Subsequently it was presented
through Doña Isabel to the queen, and was valued in Spain at 4,000
ducats. Pedrarias is further charged with divers misdemeanors. <i>Carta del

que no guardó aquí á su amigo los respetos y consecuencia que le debia. En
su disputa con Casas delante del emperador aseguró que el primer gobernador
del Darien habia sido malo, y el segundo muy peor.' <i>Quintana</i>, <i>Vidas</i>, 'Balboa,'
35. In the matter of definite dates for the events of this chapter, authorities
differ. All are more or less vague. Most of them end the career of
Vasco Nuñez with the end of 1517; which, if correct, would fix the time of
his departure from Antigua about May, 1516, for in his agreement with Pedrarias
it was arranged that the time of absence on the South Sea expedition
should be limited to eighteen months, and one of the principal charges of the
governor was that Balboa had failed in this. Among the collection of documents
in the royal archives of the Indies appears a petition presented by Fernando
de Argüello to Pedrarias and his council, in behalf of Vasco Nuñez, requesting
an extension of the time. At the foot of the petition is a decree, dated January
13, 1518, granting an extension of four months. Either the document
is fictitious, or its date erroneous, or contemporary writers are in error. I am
quite sure that Pedrarias never gave any extension, since the authorities are
clear and positive on that point, and the incidents of the narrative hinge
upon it. Compare copy of this document in <i>Pacheco</i> and <i>Cárdenas</i>, <i>Col. Doc.</i>,
ii. 556-8;
<i>Carta de Alonso de la Puente y Diego de Marquez</i>, in <i>id.</i>, 538-49;
Moreri and Miravel y Casadevante in <i>El Gran. Dic.</i>;
<i>Burney's Discov. South
Sea</i>, i. 12;
<i>Naharro</i>, <i>Relacion</i>, in <i>Doc. Inéd. para Hist. Esp.</i>, xxvi. 232. As
to the date of Quevedo's leaving Darien and his arrival in Spain there are
grave differences. Herrera sends the bishop to Spain in 1518, to report the
misgovernment of Pedrarias. Oviedo states that Quevedo left Darien soon
after the reconciliation of Vasco Nuñez and Pedrarias, and yet does not
speak of his being in Spain until 1519, 'era llegado.' It is known that
Quevedo spent some time in Cuba, urging Diego Velazquez to apply for the
governorship of Castilla del Oro. The petition of Argüello for the extension
of the time of absence of Vasco Nuñez, before mentioned, contains the name
of Quevedo as one of those who acted upon it, which only the more conclusively
proves that document fictitious. Stranger than all this, however,
is the statement in the royal cédula, dated June 18, 1519, ordering the ships
of Balboa to be delivered to Gil Gonzalez, that Vasco Nuñez was then a
prisoner. So singular is this culpable ignorance, or carelessness, or deception,
regarding the death of Vasco Nuñez, on the part of the royal officials,
as at first to raise grave doubts regarding the date of his death, were it not
proved by many collateral incidents.

<p class='footnote' id='FN_XII-3'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XII-3'>[XII-3]</a></span> There are several streams of this name between the Atrato and the Colorado,
but none of them suit the occasion. Modern maps give a Rio Balsas
flowing into the gulf of San Miguel from the south, its source turned the farthest
possible away from Acla. On a map of Joannis de Laet, 1633, <i>Nov.
Orb.</i>, 347, midway between the gulf of San Miguel and Panamá, are the
words <i>R de la balsa</i>. They are placed opposite Acla; the mouth of a river only
is given, the stream not being laid down. The same may be said of the <i>R. de la
balse</i> of Montanus, <i>Nieuwe Weereld</i>, 1671, which is in about the same locality.
The Rio Chepo is the only stream approaching the description in that vicinity.
In my opinion both of these map-makers were wrong; neither the Rio
Chepo nor any other stream in that neighborhood was the Rio Balsas of Vasco
Nuñez. The head-waters of the Rio Chucunaque are nearer the old site of
Acla than those of the Rio Chepo, or of any other southward flowing stream;
and yet I do not think the Chucunaque the Balsas of Vasco Nuñez. Says Pascual
de Andagoya, <i>Navarrete</i>, <i>Col. de Viages</i>, iii. 404, 'Le envió á la provincia de
Acla á poblar un pueblo, que es el que agora está que se dice Acla, y de allí le
dió gente que fuese al rio de la Balsa, y hiciese dos navíos para bajar por
él á la mar del sur ... y bajados al golfo de S. Miguel se anegaban,' etc.; from
which, and from the objects and incidents of the enterprise, as given by
various authors, I am inclined to believe the Rio de las Balsas of Vasco Nuñez
to be the stream now known as the Rio Sabana. The fact of distance alone,
commonly estimated at 22 leagues, but which Las Casas makes '24 y 25
leguas de sierras altísimas,' inclines me to this opinion, not to mention
several others pointing in the same direction, which will clearly appear in
the text.

Miguel, and thence to the Pearl Islands; and that there they soon foundered.
<i>Relacion de los sucesos de Pedrarias Dávila</i>, in <i>Navarrete</i>, <i>Col. de Viages</i>, iii.

other authorities.

<p class='footnote' id='FN_XII-6'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XII-6'>[XII-6]</a></span> If I have applied strong terms of denunciation to Pedrarias Dávila, it is because
he unquestionably deserves it. He is by far the worst man who came
officially to the New World during its early government. In this all authorities
agree. And all agree that Vasco Nuñez was not deserving of death.
Andagoya, <i>Relacion</i>, in <i>Navarrete</i>, <i>Col. de Viages</i>, iii. 403-5, is an excellent
authority. Says Las Casas, <i>Hist. Ind.</i>, iv. 240, 'Dijeron que esta falsedad ó
testimonio falso, ó quizá verdad, escribió Garabito á Pedrarias porque Vasco
Nuñez, por una india que tenia por amiga, le habia de palabra maltratado.'
Some of the more knowing among the chroniclers say that God punished
Vasco Nuñez with this death for his treatment of Nicuesa. Will they
at the same time tell us for what God permitted Pedrarias to live? 'Desta
manera acabó el adelantamiento de Vasco Nuñez, descubridor de la mar del
Sur, é pagó la muerte del capitan Diego de Nicuesa; por la qual é por otras
culpas permitió Dios que oviesse tal muerte, é no por lo quel pregon deçia,
porque la que llamaban traycion, ninguno la tuvo por tal.' <i>Oviedo</i>, iii. 60.
Herrera everywhere speaks in the highest terms of Vasco Nuñez, and pronounces
the character and conduct of Pedrarias detestable. Says Gomara,
<i>Hist. Ind.</i>, 85, 'Ni pareciera delante del gouernador, aunque mas su suegro
fuera. Juntosele con esto, la muerte de Diego de Nicuesa, y sus sesenta compañeros.
La prision del bachiller Enciso, y que era vãdolero reboltoso, cruel,
y malo para Indios.' Of Balboa's denial of guilt, in <i>Hist. Mondo Nvovo</i>, i. 51,
Benzoni writes, 'Valboa con giuramento negò, dicendo, che in quanto toccaua
alla informatione che contra lui s'era fatta di solleuargli la gente che l'era à
torto, e falsamente accusato, e che considerasse bene quello che faceua, e se lui
hauesse tal cosa tentata, non saria venuto alla presentia sua, e similmente del
resto, si difese il meglio che puote ma dove regnano le forze, poco gioua defendersi
con la ragione.' And Peter Martyr, dec. iv. cap. ix., testifies,
'Vaschum ab Austro accersit Petrus Arias: paret dicto Vaschus, in catenas
conjicitur. Negat Vaschus tale consilium cogitasse. Testes quæruntur malefactorum,
quæ patraverat: ab initio dicta colliguntur, morte dignus censetur,
perimitur.' And 'what stomach' he further adds, 'Pedrarias Dávila may
have, should he ever return to Spain, let good men judge.'

claiming over 40,000 Spaniards as victims to the unwholesomeness of the

para el descubrimiento,' Gil Gonzalez being named captain-general. Niño
was to explore 1,000 leagues to the westward for spices, gold, silver, pearls,
and precious stones, in three ships, furnished half by the crown and half by
the explorers, who were to receive for the purpose 4,000 castellanos de oro,
from the sums to the credit of the crown in the hands of the factor of Castilla
del Oro. One twentieth of what God might thus give them, after the king
should have received his fifth, was to be devoted to pious purposes. The net
proceeds to be divided equally between the crown and the discoverers, according
to the amount contributed by each. Wages paid the crew to be counted
in the costs; or if they went on shares, two thirds should go to the king and
Niño, and one third to the captain, officers, and men. Supplies were to be
exempt from duty, and the explorers should have an interest in the lands discovered
by them. The crown agreed to furnish at Jamaica 2,000 loads of
cassava-root, and 500 hogs; also ten negro slaves, the explorer to pay the
owners for ten Indian slaves to serve as interpreters. For the faithful performance
of these and other obligations, the explorer was required to give
bonds in the sum of 2,000 ducats. Herrera, dec. ii. lib. iv. cap. i., gives only

1520, Pedrarias humbled himself to the dust before the sacred cédula;
February 5th, he talked much, saying that he had finished the ships begun by
Vasco Nuñez; that they had cost more than 50,000 ducados, beside sweat and
blood; that with them the great city of Panamá—'la cibdad de Panamá'—with
its gold mines on one side and pearl fisheries on the other, had been
founded and the country thereabout pacified, and that if the king knew all
this he would not take the ships from those who had built them and give them
to another; February 7th, Juan del Sauce declared that, unless the ships were
surrendered, all the gold, pearls, or other property taken in them would belong,
under the king's order, to the fleet of Gil Gonzalez; February 8th, Pedrarias
replied that without the ships the city could neither be sustained nor labor be
continued, and he called on the royal officers present, Puente, the treasurer,
Marquez, the contador, and Juan de Rivas, factor, to say that these things
were so; but the royal officers answered that Pedrarias must obey the king's
command and give Gil Gonzalez the ships, keeping one, perhaps, with which
to protect the city, and selling the others to Gil Gonzalez on such terms as he
and the owners might arrange. In regard to withholding the ships Pedrarias
was certainly in the right, though it was dangerous, and he claimed that he
would obey and was obeying the king; but when, on February 9th, he demanded
that Gil Gonzalez should appear in person and lay before him the
instructions and plans of the expedition, he became most coolly impudent.

<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XIV-9'>[XIV-9]</a></span> I follow the commander's own statement, made to the royal authorities
from Santo Domingo, March 6, 1524. Of this, which I quote as <i>Carta de Gil
Gonzalez Dávila al Rey</i>, I have several copies in manuscript, the best being a
part of the first volume of the Squier Collection. This collection, consisting
of twenty-three volumes of manuscripts, beside separate pieces on various
early affairs in Central America and Mexico, fell into my hands at the sale
of the library of the late E. G. Squier, so widely known as an antiquarian
and historical writer, a review of whose works will appear in a subsequent
volume. The opportunities afforded Mr Squier by his official position as
<i>chargé d'affaires</i> to Central America, in 1849, and by his researches, combined
with a natural bent as student and author, prompted the collection of books
and manuscripts relative to Central America, a large proportion of which I
found useful in filling gaps in my own sixteenth-century material. It seems
that Mr Squier intended the publication of a series of documents for history,
of which the <i>Carta de Palacio</i> was printed at Albany, 1859, and numbered I.
The first volume of the Squier Collection of Manuscripts contains, beside the
<i>Carta de Gil Gonzalez</i>, several documents on Nicaraguan discovery certified
by Navarrete, Buckingham Smith, and Squier, as true copies of the originals
in the archives at Seville and in the Hydrographic Collection, notable among
which are <i>Real Cedula de S. M. expedida en 18 de Junio de 1519, á, Pedrarias
Dávila, para que entregase los Navios de Basco Nuñez a Gil Gonzales de Avila
y los requerim<sup>tos</sup> que pasaron sobre ello</i>; and <i>Relacion Del Asiento y Capitulacion

prometió hazer en el Mar del Sur con 3 Navios, y por Capitan de ellos á Gil

Herrera and Oviedo both testify to a large island, which we might believe

at this time by the heavy rains, so that the peninsula being cut off from the

with such enthusiasm that the Spaniards even wept. This is as much as one
having only ordinary faith can be expected to believe at once, yet the strain
on one's credulity becomes more severe when the right honorable Gil Gonzalez
calls heaven to witness that he told each man and woman, apart from the
others, that God did not want unwilling service, and that each for himself
expressed a desire for it. If we allow him 15 hours for his day's work, it
makes 61 persons an hour, or one a minute, who were examined and baptized.

communication attracted the attention of the first Europeans who saw Lake
Nicaragua, and this very naturally; for it must be remembered that Gil Gonzalez
was in search of a strait or passage through the continent, and if perchance
he should find the Moluccas thereabout, his whole object would be

where Gil Gonzalez had been notified of the country and its ruler. In the
earliest reports it is found written <i>Nicaragua</i>, <i>Micaragua</i>, <i>Nicorragua</i>, and
<i>Nicarao</i>. Upon the return of Gil Gonzalez the name Nicaragua became
famous, and beside being applied to the cacique and his town, was gradually
given to the surrounding country, and to the lake. It was by some vaguely
used to designate the whole region behind and between Hibueras and Veragua.
Later there was the Provincia de Nicaragua, beside El Nuevo Reyno
de Leon. Herrera and many others mention the Indian pueblo by the lake.
For a time the lake was known as the <i>Mar Dulce</i>. Thus Colon lays it
down on his map, in 1527, as the <i>mar duce</i>, and the town or province <i>micaragua</i>.
Ribero, 1529, calls the lake <i>mar dulce</i> and the town <i>nicaragua</i>.
Munich Atlas, No. vi., gives only <i>micaragua</i>, which No. vii. makes <i>nicaragua</i>.
Ramusio, <i>Viaggi</i>, iii. 455, gives <i>Nicaragva</i> as a province. Mercator,
in his Atlas of 1574, gives the town of <i>Nicaragua</i>. Iudocus Hondius, in
<i>Drake's World Encomp.</i>, applies the term <i>Nicaragva</i> to a province or large
extent of country. Ogilby, Dampier, De Laet, and other contemporary
and later authorities extend the name to the lake.

In making settlements, as in all things relating to the New World, it was
the aim of the Spanish government to reduce details to law. At p. 19, vol. ii.
et seq., <i>Recop. de Indias</i>, we find the ordenanzas de la poblacion de ciudades
y villas begun by Charles V., in 1523, and continued by Philip II., Felipe III.,
and Felipe IV., down to 1656. Therein it was ordered that in choosing a site
for settlement, which always implied the building of a town or city, care
must be taken that the place be suitable in every respect. It should be
ascertained if it was a healthy locality, if the young natives were well and
strong, if many of the people attained old age, if the country was favorable to
agriculture or mining, and of easy access by land and sea; if by the sea, there
should be a good harbor, and, if possible, the town must be placed by a river.
Open pueblos must not be built on the seashore because of corsairs. The site
being chosen, a plan of the place must be made, the squares formed, and the
streets and lots laid out, and measured by cord and rule. The location of the
plaza, or public and official square, was of primary import, since from it to the
principal entrances ran the most important streets. After the land had been
set apart for town lots and ejidos, or commons, the country adjacent was to be
divided into four parts, one of them for the person making the settlement,
and the remainder to be assigned by lot to the settlers. In inland settlements,
the church should be located at a distance from the plaza, and on the street
running from the plaza to the church were to be placed the <i>casas reales</i>, or
offices and dwelling of the crown officials, the <i>cabildo</i>, <i>consejo</i>, or the city-hall,
the <i>aduana</i>, or custom-house, and the <i>atarazana</i>, or arsenal. Or the
church was placed on one side of the plaza; the royal houses and the municipal
house on another; the custom-house on the third; while the remaining side
might be devoted to business houses or dwellings. Thus a stranger entering
any Spanish town could find without direction all the principal places. Marketing-stalls,
usually with an awning, were admitted in the plaza. If a seaboard
town, the church must be so placed that it could be seen on entering the
harbor, and so constructed as to serve for purposes of defence. In this case
the plaza must be at the landing; if inland, in the centre of the town. In
form it must be a parallelogram, the length to be at least one and a half times
the width, as the best shape for feats of horsemanship; its size should be,
according to population, not less than 200 by 300 feet, nor more than 800 by
532 feet, a good size being 600 by 400 feet. From the plaza, whose corners
stood toward the four cardinal points, issued four principal streets, one from
the middle of each side, and two smaller streets from each corner. In cold
countries the streets had to be wide; in hot countries, narrow. Houses not
to be built within 300 <i>pasos</i> or 750 feet, of the walls or stockade. Town lots
and lands not distributed to settlers belonged to the king, and were reserved
for future settlers. Then the law states how first settlers must hasten with
their house-building, after having planted and assured themselves of food for
the season, building with economy and strength, and throwing round the
town palisades and intrenchments. The houses must be uniform, and with
good accommodations for horses.

Any ten or more married men might unite to form a new settlement, and
might elect annually from among themselves <i>alcaldes ordinarios</i> and other
municipal officers. When it was possible to establish a <i>villa de Españoles</i> with
a council of alcaldes ordinarios and regidores, and there was a responsible
person with whom to make an agreement for settlement, the agreement was
to be as follows: Within a time specified there must be from ten to thirty
settlers, each with one horse, ten milch cows, four oxen, one brood mare, one
sow, twenty ewes of Castile, six hens, and a cock. A clergyman must be provided,
the first incumbent to be named by the chief of the colony, and his successors
in accordance with the royal right of patronage. A church must be
built, which the founder of the settlement supplied with ornaments, and to
which were granted lands. Any one agreeing to form a settlement, and conforming
to the regulations, had given him land equivalent to four square
leagues, distant at least five leagues from any other Spanish settlement; and
he was himself to enter into agreement with each enrolled settler to give a
town lot, lands for pasturage and cultivation, and as many <i>peonías</i>, or shares
of foot-soldiers, and <i>caballerías</i>, or shares of cavalrymen, as each would obligate
himself to work, provided that to no one was to be given more than five peonías
or three caballerías. The principal with whom an agreement for settling
was made, to hold civil and criminal jurisdiction in first instance, during
life, and for that of one son or heir, and from him appeal might lie to the
alcalde mayor or the audiencia of the district. He might appoint alcaldes ordinarios,
regidores, and other municipal officers. Those going from Spain as
first settlers were exempted from the payment of <i>almojarifazgo</i>, or export
duty, or other crown dues, on what they took for their household and maintenance
during the first voyage to the Indies. Bachelors should be persuaded
to marry.
</p>

<p>
When a colony was about to leave a city to make a settlement, the <i>justicia</i>
and <i>regimiento</i> should file with the <i>escribano del consejo</i> a list of the persons
migrating; and lest the mother city should be depopulated, those only were
eligible who had no town lots or agricultural lands. The number of colonists
being complete, they were to elect officers, and each colonist to register
the sum he intended to employ in the enterprise. And even after the settlement
had been begun, whether as <i>colonia</i>, that is, colonists in voluntary
association, or <i>adelantamiento</i>, <i>alcaldía mayor</i>, <i>corregimiento</i>, enterprises
headed respectively by an adelantado, alcalde mayor, or corregidor, or
<i>villa</i>, or <i>lugar</i>, the fathers of it were forbidden to wholly leave the people to
themselves.
</p>

<p >
Discoverers, pacificators, first settlers and their immediate descendants,
possessed advantages over others. They were made <i>hijosdalgo de solar conocido</i>,
with all the honors, according to law and custom, of hijosdalgo and
gentlemen of Spain. They might bear arms, by giving bonds, before any
justice, that they would use them solely in self-defence. And that it
might be known who were entitled to reward, viceroys and presidents of
audiencias were directed to examine into the merits of cases, and see that a
book was kept by the <i>escribano de gobernacion</i>, in which were recorded the
services and merits of every person seeking preferment.
</p>

<p >
For the government of the settlement, the governor in whose district it
might be, had to declare whether it was to be <i>ciudad</i>, <i>villa</i>, or <i>lugar</i>, that is
to say, a town less than a <i>villa</i>, and greater than <i>aldea</i>. A <i>ciudad metropolitana</i>,
or capital of the province, to have a <i>juez</i> with the title of <i>adelantado</i>, that
is to say, a military and political governor of a province; or <i>alcalde mayor</i>, governor
of a pueblo not the capital of the province; or <i>corregidor</i>, a magistrate
with criminal jurisdiction only; or <i>alcalde ordinario</i>, mayor with criminal
jurisdiction. This <i>juez</i> was to have jurisdiction <i>in solidum</i>, and jointly with
the <i>regimiento</i>. The administration of public affairs was vested in two or
three treasury officials, twelve <i>regidores</i>, or members of the town council, appointed,
not elected; two <i>fieles ejecutores</i>, or regidores having charge of
weights; in each parish two <i>jurados</i>, who saw that people were well provided,
especially with provisions; a <i>procurador general</i>, attorney with general powers;
a <i>mayordomo</i>, having charge of public property; an <i>escribano de consejo</i>,
notary of the council; two <i>escribanos públicos</i>; one <i>escribano de minas y registros</i>;
a <i>pregonero mayor</i>, official vendue-master; a <i>corredor de lonja</i>, merchants'
broker, and two <i>porteros</i>, or janitors of the town council. If the city was
<i>diocesana</i>, or <i>sufragánea</i>, it must have eight regidores, and the other officers
in perpetuity; villas and lugares only to have an alcalde ordinario, say, four
regidores, an alguacil, or bailiff, an <i>escribano de consejo y público</i>, and a
mayordomo.

<p class='footnote' id='FN_XV-4'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XV-4'>[XV-4]</a></span> As a discoverer, his talents were unequal to the attempt. As a writer,
Andagoya figured with Oviedo, Enciso, and other noted men in the retinue of
the unscrupulous Pedrarias. Born in Alava province, he came to the Isthmus
in 1514, and took an active part in the various expeditions for its subjugation
and settlement. Through the favor of Pedrarias, whose wife's maid he married,
he rose to encomendero, to regidor of Panamá, and, in 1522, to inspector-general
of the Isthmus Indians. The present expedition, which brought back wonderful
reports of the Inca empire, might have gained him the glories of that
conquest, or at least he might have shared them with Pizarro, had his health
not broken down. As it was, he merely acquired wealth as agent for the
Peruvian hero, and although he rose afterward to adelantado and governor of
New Castile, his integrity and comparative want of audacity prevented him
from reaping the benefits within reach of less scrupulous rivals. The original
of his well-written narrative, relating the history of the Isthmus and adjoining
region in connection with his career, was found by Navarrete in the
Seville Archives, and published in his <i>Col. de Viages</i>, iii. 393-459, from which
source Markham made the translation issued in 1865 by the Hakluyt Society.
Oviedo's account of Andagoya's career, from a different source, iv. 126-32, confirms
the general exactness of his narrative, although Acosta, <i>Comp. Hist.
Nueva Granada</i>, 383, declares it colored with a view to advocate his claim to
the governorship of New Castile. <i>Helps' Span. Conq.</i>, iii. 426, and <i>March y
Labores</i>, <i>Marina Española</i>, ii. 121, give Andagoya's voyage.

will regard it as a <i>pena peccati</i>, but explains that Olid had no share in
this expedition, as he himself had had in the one from Cuba. With respect
to the present fleet, he regretted not so much the loss of 40,000 pesos de
oro as the injury the rebellion must cause the imperial interest, in delay of
exploration and settlement and in excesses against Indians. Further,
he remarks pointedly, such revolts will deter loyal and enterprising men

Bernal Diaz places the number of vessels at five and the soldiers at 100, naming
3 conquistadores. <i>Hist. Verdad.</i>, 194. Out of the 150 the soldiers probably
did number 100, and there may have been five vessels, for Herrera states that
Cortés sent a ship with stores under Pedro Gonzalez to follow Casas. Off the
very coast of Honduras he was overtaken by a storm which drove him back to
Pánuco with the belief that the fleet must have perished, dec. iii. lib. v. cap.

an advantage over Gil Gonzalez, capturing over 50 of his men; but he now
released them under certain conditions. <i>Cortés</i>, <i>Cartas</i>, 459. Bernal Diaz

<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XVII-22'>[XVII-22]</a></span> After the defeat by Briones, Gil Gonzalez seems to have become bewildered.
Leaving a few followers at Nito under Diego de Armenta, he embarked
in three vessels, touched at San Gil to hang Francisco Riquelme and a
clergyman for having led a revolt, and thence proceeded to Choloma. Owing
to Briones' defection his capture was intrusted to Juan Ruano. <i>Herrera</i>, dec.
iii. lib. v. cap. xiii. The seizure was effected with the loss of his nephew Gil
de Ávila and eight soldiers. <i>Bernal Diaz</i>, <i>Hist. Verdad.</i>, 194;

<p class='footnote' id='FN_XVII-25'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XVII-25'>[XVII-25]</a></span> According to Herrera, the confessor, awed by the proclamation, revealed
the hiding-place, after exacting a promise that no harm should befall his
protégé. The promise was disregarded on the principle that 'dead man wages
no war,' and although Olid <i>was dead</i> when the hour came for execution, yet
the <i>corpse</i> was publicly beheaded, dec. iii. lib. v. cap. xii. Other authorities
do not state how he was discovered or arrested. 'Otro dia por la mañana,
hecho su proceso contra él, ambos los capitanes (Casas and Gonzalez) juntamente
le sentenciaron á muerte.' <i>Cortés</i>, <i>Cartas</i>, 460. 'Assi fenecio su vida,
por tener en poco su contrario.' <i>Gomara</i>, <i>Hist. Mex.</i>, 244. His brother, Antonio
de Olid, sought justice before the Consejo de Indias against Casas and
Gonzalez for the murder. <i>Herrera</i>, dec. iii. lib. x. cap. xi.

These did not comprise Gonzalez' followers, but may have been all of Olid's
and Casas' men who cared to remain in Honduras; yet it seems strange that
the latter should have allowed so large a number to abandon a province which
they had been sent to occupy.
</p>

<p class='footnote' id='FN_XVII-28'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XVII-28'>[XVII-28]</a></span> Oviedo assumes that Casas would brook no rival after his triumph, and
made Gonzalez a prisoner, 'é llevólo en grillos á la Nueva España.' iii. 188-9,
518. The last assertion is even less likely. Affairs had meanwhile changed
in Mexico, and like Casas he fell into the hands of Cortés' enemies, who were
at first intent on their execution, but ultimately sent both to Spain for trial.
One of the charges was the murder of Olid. Gonzalez was wrecked on Fayal
Island, but reached Seville in April, 1526, only to be confined in the atarazana,
or arsenal. Released on parole, as a knight commander of Santiago, he
returned to his home at Ávila, and there died not long after, says Oviedo,
deeply repentant of his sins. <i>Dávila</i>, <i>Testimonio</i>, in <i>Pacheco</i> and <i>Cárdenas</i>,

after Casas' triumph, but the testimony in <i>Pacheco</i> and <i>Cárdenas</i>, <i>Col. Doc.</i>,
ii. 127, etc., shows that he had been picked up by Moreno at San Gil.
</p>

<p class='footnote' id='FN_XVII-31'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XVII-31'>[XVII-31]</a></span> He himself being the probable captain. Some sixteen slaves were kidnapped
here, and the rest at San Gil. The account of Moreno's proceedings,
by different witnesses, is to be found in <i>Informacion hecha por órden de Hernan

and in <i>Relacion de los Oidores</i>, in <i>id.</i>, xiv. 39, etc. When the emperor learned
of the kidnapping, he angrily ordered the release of the slaves, and their good
treatment pending an investigation. <i>Herrera</i>, dec. iii. lib. x. cap. xi. Cortés
intimates that Ruano had used persuasion with Moreno to obtain the command.

</p>

<p class='footnote' id='FN_XVIII-1'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XVIII-1'>[XVIII-1]</a></span> Herrera assumes stronger reasons, the arrival of the supply vessel sent
after Casas with the report that the latter could not have escaped the
storm which drove her back to Mexico, and the rumored victory of Olid over
both his opponents. But it is pretty certain that Cortés heard nothing of the
latter affair, at least while he was in Mexico, dec. iii. lib. v. cap. xiii.
</p>

<p class='footnote' id='FN_XVIII-2'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XVIII-2'>[XVIII-2]</a></span> The safety of Mexico was above other considerations; the road to Honduras
was unknown and full of danger; the emperor would punish Olid. Such
were the arguments used. Cortés replied that unless prompt chastisement
was inflicted others would follow the example, and disorder must follow,
with loss to himself of respect and territory. The crown officials demanded
in the emperor's name that he should remain. <i>Gomara</i>, <i>Hist. Mex.</i>, 245. Cortés
yielded, and wrote to the emperor that he had intended to march through
Guatemala but would remain, especially since he expected news from Honduras
within two months. <i>Carta</i>, Oct. 15, 1524. A few days later he began his
march.

<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XVIII-4'>[XVIII-4]</a></span> In the letter from Honduras he says October 12, but this very generally

that he was still at Mexico; but he was on the way before November.

appointed by Cortés over Mexico, relates in a letter to the emperor, dated
15 December, 1525, that according to reports from Xicalanco traders to Ordaz,
the party of Cortés had been killed seven to eight moons before, in an island
city, seven suns distant from Xicalanco, called Cuzamelco. They had been
surprised by night and slaughtered with sword and fire. A number of captives
had been reserved for the table, but the flesh being found bitter of taste it had
been cast into the lake. <i>Icazbalceta</i>, <i>Col. Doc.</i>, i. 485-6.

food. <i>Hist. Verdad.</i>, 200. The above seems doubtful.

<p class='footnote' id='FN_XVIII-31'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XVIII-31'>[XVIII-31]</a></span> The plan is said to have been imparted to sympathizers in Mexico, with
the recommendation to rise on a certain day against the colonists. 'Y de
aqui creyeron muchos que naciò la fama de la muerte de Cortes.' <i>Herrera</i>, dec.
iii. lib. vii. cap. ix. For this uprising there was opportunity enough, says
Gomara, during the anarchy prevalent during Cortés' absence; but the Indians
were waiting further orders from Quauhtemotzin. Finally their preparations
aroused the suspicions of the colonists, and they took precautions. <i>Hist. Mex.</i>,
250, 258. According to Cortés the Indians, after killing the Spaniards, were
to rouse Honduras and the intermediate country ere they passed on to Mexico.
All vessels were to be seized, so as to prevent alarm from being given. <i>Cartas</i>,

Bernal Diaz states that the revelation was made by two prominent caciques,
Tapia and Juan Velazquez, the latter captain-general under Quauhtemotzin
when he was ruler. <i>Hist. Verdad.</i>, 200. According to Ixtlilxochitl, the Indians
were imitating the Spaniards in the festivities which precede Lent, but in such
a manner as to arouse the suspicion of Cortés. One cause for the enjoyment
was a statement by Cortés that here they would turn back to Mexico. The
general called his spy Costemexi, of Ixtapalapan or Mexicaltzinco, and bade
him ascertain what was going on. He soon returned to report that the three
kings and six courtiers had been engaged in a humorous dispute as to which
of the trio the now conquered provinces should belong to. Tlacatecatl, one
of the chief lords, thereupon observed that if discord had brought about the
fall of the native empire, they had gained instead the supreme happiness of
instruction in the true faith. After this came tales and songs. When tortured
some years after by Prince Ixtlilxochitl, the spy insisted that he had
represented the case only as above stated, but that Cortés chose to interpret
it as a malicious plot. <i>Horribles Crueldades</i>, 90-3. This version is doubtful in
its details, and for the reason that the author's chief effort is to vindicate the
natives. The cause for the rejoicing at a return to Mexico from Acalan savors
rather of a promise from the conspirators than from Cortés.

castigados,' if required. The execution took place within a few days of the
disclosure. <i>Cartas</i>, 421. Bernal Diaz, Herrera, and Gomara agree. The latter
adds that king Cohuanacoch, of Tezcuco, who had also plotted, died some time
before of bad food and water. <i>Hist. Mex.</i>, 274. Torquemada adds five caciques
to the three royal victims, according to the native version. i. 576.

February 26, 1525, specifies Vetancurt; on a Tuesday, three hours before dawn,
adds Ixtlilxochitl, who also declares that the native songs and versions place
it at Teotilac, and it certainly appears to have been carried out before the capital
was reached. The Mexicans were so oppressed by hardships, says Bernal
Diaz, that they seemed to be quite indifferent; still, the Spaniards hastened
the departure for fear of an uprising. He places the occurrence at a pueblo
beyond Acalan. Ixtlilxochitl tells another story. The kings were brought
out three hours before dawn for fear of a tumult. The two of Mexico and
Tlacopan had already been hanged, and Cohuanacoch was about to be, when
his brother, Ixtlilxochitl, being advised, rushed forth and called upon the Indians.
Perceiving the danger, Cortés cut the rope and saved the half-strangled
king of Tezcuco. He thereupon proceeded to explain to Ixtlilxochitl the just
reasons which had brought about the execution. The prince appeared
convinced, and dismissed the auxiliaries, who stood ready to fall upon the
Spaniards. The chief motive, however, for sparing them, was not the justice
of the deed, for he regarded it ever as a treacherous one, but the fear of wars
that might result from a revolt and carry desolation over his country, checking
the progress of the saving faith. Cohuanacoch, whom Cortés accused as the
chief conspirator, was carried with the army in a hammock, suffering severely
from the wrenching of the noose. His grief brought about an intestinal hemorrhage,
from which he died within a few days. <i>Horribles Crueldades</i>, 98-4.

<p class='footnote' id='FN_XVIII-37'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XVIII-37'>[XVIII-37]</a></span> 'Y sin auer mas prouãças, Cortes mandò ahorcar al Guatemuz, y al señor
de Tacuba.... Y fue esta muerte que les dieron muy injustamente dada, y pareciò
mal a todos los que ibamos aquella jornada.' <i>Bernal Diaz</i>, <i>Hist. Verdad.</i>,
200. But his account of all this expedition is questionable, and his testimony
loses force through the evident fact that he is carried away by sympathy for
the kings, who had often favored him, and for the natives to whom his later condition
in life bound him rather closely. He certainly admits the strong accusation
and the confirmatory admission of the victims, the king of Tlacopan stating,
for instance, that he and Quauhtemotzin had declared one death preferable
to the daily deaths suffered. Torquemada adopts the version of a Tezcucan
manuscript, which relates that Cohuanacoch on one occasion remarked to his
royal confrères that, if they chose to be disloyal, the Spaniards might have to
regret past injuries. Quauhtemotzin hastened to silence him by observing
that walls had ears, which might misunderstand such expressions. A plebeian
native reported them, and that very night those who had been present
at the conversation, three kings and five caciques, were found hanging from a
ceiba-tree. Torquemada will not believe that the Indians intended to revolt,
especially since their country was now divided, but that Cortés regarded the
kings as a burden, i. 575-6. Cavo, <i>Tres Siglos</i>, i. 46-8, agrees, and Gomara
even intimates something to this effect in saying that Cortés ought to have
preserved so prominent and brave a captive to point the triumph of his victories,
but that the dangerous circumstances must have prevented him. <i>Hist.
Mex.</i>, 259. 'Es notorio, que Quauhtemoc y los demás señores murieron sin
culpa, y que les levantaron falso testimonio.' Indeed, continues Ixtlilxochitl,
when the Indians complained to the kings of maltreatment, they counselled
submission. But his story is so full of glaring misstatements and absurdities,
and so evident is the desire to relieve his kinsmen from the traitor's brand,
that he cannot be relied on. <i>Horribles Crueldades</i>, 82, etc.;
<i>Id.</i>, <i>Relaciones</i>,
<i>Kingsborough's Mex. Antiq.</i>, ix. 440, etc. Brasseur de Bourbourg follows him
implicitly of course, as he does almost any record from native source. There
was no witness except the spy, and the princes were not allowed to defend
themselves. <i>Hist. Nat. Civ.</i>, iv. 608. He evidently pays no attention whatever
to the Spanish versions. Bustamante accepts even more implicitly
the records of those whom he prefers to regard as his ancestors. See his
edition of Gomara, <i>Chimalpain</i>, <i>Hist. Conq.</i>, ii. 135-6. Cano, who married the
cousin and widow of Quauhtemotzin, calls the execution of the three kings a
murder, as may be expected from his dislike of Cortés. <i>Oviedo</i>, iii. 549.
Carried away by hyperbolic flights of fancy, wherein he surpasses even Solis
himself, Salazar condemns the deed as based on false testimony, and blames
Cortés for irritating the natives by resorting to so rash a measure. <i>Conq. Mex.</i>,
240-3. Father Duran emphasizes this with well-known sympathy for the
native cause. 'Y levantándose contra él algunos testigos falsos le mandó á
horcar.' <i>Hist. Ind.</i>, MS., ii. 522. On imperfect evidence and without a trial,
says <i>Robertson</i>, <i>Hist. Am.</i>, ii. 138. Prescott sympathizes with Quauhtemotzin
and regards the testimony as insufficient, while Helps, <i>Cortés</i>, 208-9, doubts
the statements of Bernal Diaz, and refers to the act as cruel practical wisdom.
The chief ground for this view is that Cortés, as an hidalgo, would not lie, and
can therefore be relied upon. It has not been my fortune to acquire such
faith, and I fancy that a closer study of his hero might have changed Sir
Arthur Helps' views. Alaman, a Mexican with Spanish sympathies, believes
in the conspiracy, but regards the execution as a blot on Cortés. Quauhtemotzin,
at least, should have been sent to Spain after the fall of Mexico.
<i>Disert.</i>, i. 214. This certainly would have been the best way to secure and
make use of him. Pizarro y Orellana, <i>Varones Ilvstres</i>, 114-16, regards the
evidence as clear and the execution as just; so does Revilla, although his
reasons are not the best. <i>Solis</i>, <i>Conq. Mex.</i> (ed. 1843), 508.

<p class='footnote' id='FN_XVIII-38'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XVIII-38'>[XVIII-38]</a></span> It is not improbable that suspicions as to the thoughts and acts of the
kings may have created a prejudice against them, but the suspicions existed
already before they left Mexico, as proved by their being taken not only as
hostages for the loyalty of their subjects, but as a precaution against their
own possible disloyalty. Quauhtemotzin was evidently not the most submissive
of men, for he had always been regarded as requiring a close watch, and
Cortés brought him chiefly because of his 'bullicioso' character, as he expresses
it. It may not be considered unpardonable for the Indian auxiliaries
to relieve their feelings in mutinous expressions against the taskmasters and
despoilers who were taking them away from home to meet an unknown fate,
to endure toil, hunger, and danger. But such sentiments could not be overlooked
in the kings. They, as captured leaders, existed only by sufferance,
the condition being good behavior. For them even to listen was to encourage,
and they were consequently guilty. Not that I blame them. Nay,
I would rather blame them for not being more prompt and determined in the
patriotic effort. But in resolving to listen, and to act, no doubt, they accepted
a risk with a penalty well defined among all peoples. Cortés was not the man
to hesitate at almost any deed when private or public interests demanded it;
and it needed but little to rouse to blind fury the slumbering suspicions of the
soldiers regarding Mexican loyalty. But here we have evidence—not groundless
even from a native point of view—to justify the Spaniards in assuming
that a conspiracy, or, at least, mutinous talk, was wide-spread, and this among
a horde tenfold superior in number; a horde known ever to have cherished unfriendly
feelings, and now doubly embittered by suffering. Under the circumstances
even saints would not have disregarded testimony however doubtful;
and the Castilians were but human. Self-preservation, ay, duty to king, and
country, and God, whose several interests they were defending, demanded the
prompt suppression of so ominous a danger. What were the best measures?
A long campaign in Mexico had impressed Cortés with the belief that a people
so trained to abject subservience as the Aztecs, and so bloody in their
worship, could be controlled by severity alone, and that the lesson must fall
on the leaders. Situated as they were the soldiers could not be expected to
guard a large number of captives. Hence no course remained, except capital
punishment. According to Bernal Diaz, <i>Hist. Verdad.</i>, 201, Cortés' distress
of mind at the sufferings of the expedition was so increased by this deed that
he became sleepless, and, in wandering around one night in a temple forming
the camp, he fell from a platform a distance of ten feet, hurting his head
severely.

<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XVIII-44'>[XVIII-44]</a></span> So write Bernal Diaz and Villagutierre. Pinelo, <i>Relacion</i>, 1, 2, has it
Taiza or Atitza. Two leagues from shore, says Cortés, on an island known
as Peten Itza, Peten signifying island. Its present name is Remedios, and on
the ruins of the old pueblo has risen the town of Flores. The name of Peten
lives in that of the province. A romantic account is given of the rise of this
lake people. The Itzas were a branch of one of the most ancient nations of
Yucatan, whose name had descended on them as followers of the hero-god
Itzamná. Chichen Itza, their capital, was once a centre of power and wealth
in the peninsula, but with the changing fortunes of war came disunion, and
in the beginning of the 15th century the feared Itzas had dwindled into a
number of petty principalities ruled by caneks. 'El Cazique à quien comunmente
llaman Canek.' <i>Cogolludo</i>, <i>Hist. Yucathan</i>, 54. It so happened that one
of these fell in love, but found an obstacle in a father, who awarded the object
of his affections to a more powerful chief. The canek was not to be thus
easily balked. He watched his opportunity, and on the wedding-day broke
in upon the festive assembly and carried off the bride. Gathering his warriors,
the disappointed rival prepared to wreak vengeance and recover the prize.
The Ilium of our hero was not fitted to withstand such hosts, and he had no
other alternative than flight. Nor could his subjects hope to escape desolation,
and taking up the cause of their leader, they followed him southward
in search of a new home, safe from the avenger. Guided by craggy ranges,
the refugees came to the smiling valley of Tayasal, with its island-studded
lake, bordered by verdure-clad slopes, beyond which rose the shielding forest.
Here indeed was a land of promise, where, guarded by Itzamná, they might
rear new generations to perpetuate the name and traditions of their race. So
runs the story as related by chroniclers, although with their devout frame of
mind they give preference to another account, which attributes the migration
to the prophecies of their priests, foretelling the coming of a bearded race,
with a new faith, to rule over the land. <i>Villagutierre</i>, <i>Hist. Conq. Itza</i>, 29-31;

three families, whereupon the Indians attacked and wounded twelve Spaniards,

saddlery, and other useful material, was turned back from Cuba by the survivors
of Ávalos' expedition. She touched at Santo Domingo on her way to
Honduras. <i>Hist. Mex.</i>, 270. Cortés shows that the news of Ávalos' shipwreck

50,000 castellanos, a like amount being also expended by his followers. He
had conquered, pacified, and settled over 200 leagues of territory, founding
three towns on the best parts of the coast; he had expended over 25,000

with independent sovereignty over a portion of his kingdom his brother
Ahpoxahil, who held his court at Tecpanatitan [Tzolola]; and that these two
rulers, without informing the neighboring lords of their intention, conjointly
sent embassadors to Cortés with offers of peace and submission. <i>Chronica de
Gvat.</i>, 68. Brasseur de Bourbourg takes this view, and states that when the
secret alliance became known the indignation was general. A confederation
for the destruction of the Cakchiquels was formed, and a struggle of fearful
bloodiness had been carried on for some months when the confederates received
the news that the Tonatiuh was advancing through Soconusco against
them. <i>Brasseur de Bourbourg</i>, <i>Hist. Nat. Civ.</i>, iv. 630. But Cortés distinctly

differ. Bernal Diaz assigns December 13th as the day of departure; Ixtlilxochitl,
December 8th. <i>Horribles Crueldades</i>, 71; Fuentes, November 19th, and
Vazquez, November 13th. Vazquez states that this last is the date given in the
original manuscript of Bernal Diaz, though the printed copy gives December
13th. <i>Chronica de Gvat.</i>, 523. The number of forces at the second mustering
is stated by Cortés to have been 120 horsemen, with 40 spare animals, and 300
foot-soldiers, of whom 130 were cross-bowmen and arquebusiers. There were
also several persons of high rank from Mexico and the neighboring cities with
the native troops; but the latter were not numerous, on account of the distance
of the proposed scene of action. A park of four pieces of artillery completed
the equipment. Oviedo follows Cortés. Bernal Diaz, <i>Hist. Verdad.</i>,
174, gives the number of arquebusiers and cross-bowmen as 120, and that of
the horsemen 135, with above 200 Tlascaltecs and Cholultecs, besides 100
picked Mexicans. Herrera, dec. iii. lib. v. cap. viii., assigns 300 Spaniards,
100 of whom were arquebusiers, with 160 horses. Vazquez, <i>Chronica de Gvat.</i>,
4, says the force consisted of 300 Spaniards with Tlascaltec, Mexican, and
Cholultec allies. Without making any mention of the guns, which the
above authorities do not omit, Fuentes says the force was composed of 750
hombres de calidad, as follows: 300 foot-soldiers, arquebusiers, and cross-bowmen,
135 horsemen, and four guns under the artilleryman Usagre, written in
Bernal Diaz as Viagre; but 750 must be an error, since the artillerymen would
thus number 315; 450 is probably the intended number. To these were added
200 Tlascaltec and Cholultec bowmen, and 100 picked Mexicans. This author,
moreover, gives a list of the names of nearly 200 conquistadores. <i>Recordacion
Florida</i>, MS., 25-7. Gomara has 420 Spaniards, with 170 horses, four pieces
of artillery, a great quantity of stores, and a large number of Mexican troops.
'Mucha gente Mexicana.' <i>Hist. Ind.</i>, 267. Brasseur de Bourbourg gives the
forces as 300 foot-soldiers, 120 of whom were arquebusiers or cross-bowmen,
135 horsemen, with four pieces of artillery, 200 warriors of Tlascala and
Cholula, 10,000 each of Mexico and Acolhuacan, besides a large number
of porters and carriers. <i>Hist. Nat. Civ.</i>, 632. This last author is supported
by Ixtlilxochitl, who states that Ixtlilxochitl and Quauhtemoctzin
supplied Cortés each with 10,000 warriors, under the command of able captains.
<i>Horribles Crueldades</i>, 65-6. And with regard to the native contingent
troops, we have additional evidence that they were far more numerous than
Cortés chose to represent them to the Spanish monarch. The Xochimilco
Indians, whose city lay five leagues from Mexico, sent in a petition for redress
of grievances, dated 2d May, 1563, in which they claim to have furnished
Alvarado, their encomendero, with 2500 warriors for the conquest of
Honduras and Guatemala. <i>Pacheco</i> and <i>Cárdenas</i>, <i>Col. Doc.</i>, viii. 293-4. By
royal edict the employment of natives beyond their own borders had been
forbidden; hence, to diminish the magnitude of the disobedience, the number
was diminished.

Martinez de Pontaza, according to Vazquez, <i>Chronica de Gvat.</i>, 524. This
writer enters into a long argument to prove that Bartolomé de Olmedo, of the
order of Nuestra Señora de la Merced, could not have accompanied the expedition,
as stated by Bernal Diaz, <i>Hist. Verdad.</i>, 174. Vazquez, with the aid
of two other friars, compared the original manuscript of Bernal Diaz with
the printed work published in 1632, and found the last mention of Olmedo
in the manuscript to be in chapter clvii. He had a suspicion that the passages
in later chapters where Olmedo's connection with the expedition is
mentioned may be interpolations by the Friar Alonso Remon, who was of
the same order as Olmedo, and who first published the <i>Historia Verdadera</i>.

the natives presented offerings of gold. <i>Hist. Verdad.</i>, 174. This idea may
have arisen from the fact that some towns did submit without active opposition,
as recorded or implied by Gomara and Herrera. Remesal says that
Alvarado passed on like a thunderbolt, conquering by force of arms and exciting
great terror by reason of the carnage at Soconusco. That the destruction
was great is evident from the ruins to be seen at the entrance into Guatemala,
in the locality called the Sacrificadero. <i>Hist. Chyapa</i>, 3. Brasseur de Bourbourg
affirms that Alvarado, as he passed through this district, founded a
Spanish colony at Huehuetan, which was long the capital of the territory after
the destruction of the city of Soconusco. <i>Hist. Nat. Civ.</i>, iv. 633-4. This could
have been only a concentration of the already resident Spaniards, for Alvarado

ten lords joined him with 24,000 men, and 46,000 arrived from other quarters,

been protected by palisades and ditches, and only by the most indefatigable
exertions, now destroying trenches and stone barricades, now climbing rugged
steeps by help of feet and hands, were the Spaniards able to reach the plain
above. Moreover, the devil was at hand to help his own, and he wrought
against the good Spaniards by means of diabolical transformations in lightning
and whirlwinds, and otherwise convulsed elements; and by fearful
apparitions and transformations into wild beasts. <i>Chronica de Gvat.</i>, 5. This,

<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XXIV-7'>[XXIV-7]</a></span> It is possible that Oxib Quieh was hanged, and not burned, though
Alvarado makes no mention of such weakness on his part, but states distinctly
'Yo los quemé.' <i>Relacion</i>, i. 159. Bernal Diaz, however, asserts that
through the intercession of Fray Bartolomé Olmedo a respite of two days was
granted the unfortunate king, during which time he was converted and
baptized, and that his sentence was commuted to hanging. <i>Hist. Verdad.</i>, 175.
This view is taken by Salazar y Olarte, <i>Conq. Mex.</i>, 125-6, and Juarros, <i>Guat.</i>,
ii. 253, but not by Ixtlilxochitl, <i>Horribles Crueldades</i>, 67. At the trial of
Alvarado this act of barbarity constitutes one of the charges, and the testimony
tends to prove that no exception was made in favor of any one of the victims.
The witness Francisco Flores, mentioned in <a href="#FN_XXIV-5">note 5</a>, this chapter, states that
one of the nobles was spared, because he had disclosed the plot. His testimony
may, however, be founded on a respite granted to Oxib Quieh, incorrectly
understood by Flores. <i>Ramirez</i>, <i>Proceso contra Alvarado</i>, 32. Alvarado informed
Cortés that the victims made full confession of the plot before they
were put to death, and his use of the expression 'Como parecera por sus confesiones'
would seem to indicate that the confessions were taken down in
writing and forwarded to Cortés. <i>Relacion</i>, i. 159. In conclusion, Brasseur
de Bourbourg says that only the monarch and the heir presumptive were
burned, which is at variance with Juarros' expression, 'Ni las muertes de sus
primeros capitanes, ni las de sus dos Reyes, executadas por los Castellanos,'
<i>Guat.</i>, ii. 253, and also with the testimony of Flores, who says, 'E los prendio
a todos ... e despues los quemo.' <i>Ramirez</i>, <i>Proceso contra Alvarado</i>, 32. Las

According to Brasseur de Bourbourg the princes of the Cakchiquel nation
met with much opposition from their subjects in supporting the Spaniards,
and the nobles refused to supply the troops demanded by Alvarado. In this
embarrassment the Ahpozotzil raised 4000 warriors in his capital. <i>Hist. Nat.
Civ.</i>, 648. Bernal Diaz, followed by Juarros, gives a different account from that
of Alvarado, which is followed in the text. It is to the effect that the people
of Guatemala, hearing of Alvarado's repeated victories, and learning that he
was stationed at Utatlan, sent an embassy with presents of gold, offering their
services against the Quichés, with whom they were at enmity. These were
accepted by Alvarado, who, to test their sincerity, and also because he was
ignorant of the road, asked and received assistance across the many gullies
and through the difficult passes. <i>Hist. Verdad.</i>, 175.

the surrounding tribes. <i>Guat.</i>, ii. 254. Herrera states that the war terminated

by different authors with routes followed by him at later dates. Juarros says
that he did not pass through the towns of the coast, but along the Itzapa road;
for in a land title possessed by the Indians of Parramos, extended in the year
1577, on the 10th of November, in a reference to a plain on said road, this
expression occurs: 'Where they say the camp of the Spaniards was pitched
when the Adelantado D. Pedro de Alvarado came to conquer this land.' <i>Guat.</i>,
ii. 255. By these remarks Juarros supports Fuentes' opinion that the capital
of the Cakchiquel nation was situated on the slopes of the Volcan de Agua.
I am, however, persuaded that the encampment mentioned in the land title
took place later, on the occasion of Alvarado's campaign southward.

took place in the palace; that the martial aspect of the population, and the
number of warriors, excited the suspicions of Alvarado; and that on the night
after his arrival, agitated by his apprehensions, he suddenly entered the royal
apartments, followed by his officers. His unexpected presence caused great
confusion, and the nobles in waiting rallied round their sovereign. The conversation
then followed, when Sinacam spoke thus: 'Would I have sent my
warriors and braves to die for you and find a tomb at Gumarcaah if I had
such treacherous intentions?' In his explanation, also, the king states that
the armed troops were intended to be directed against the provinces of Itzcuintlan
and Atitlan, with which nations the Cakchiquels were at war. <i>Brasseur

<p class='footnote' id='FN_XXV-4'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XXV-4'>[XXV-4]</a></span> Bernal Diaz, or his editor, here introduces Friar Bartolomé de Olmedo.
His story is this: When the Spaniards arrived at Guatemala, Alvarado told
the friar that he had never been so hard pressed as when fighting with the
Indians of Utatlan, describing them as most brave and excellent warriors,
and at the same time claimed to himself the merit of having done a good
work. The friar chided him, and said it was God who had wrought the deed;
and in order that he might regard it as good, and aid them in future, it would
be well to give thanks to him, appoint a holiday, celebrate mass, and preach
to the Indians. This injunction was carried out, and resulted in the baptism
of more than 30 natives in two days. Others also were anxious to be baptized
when they perceived that the Spaniards held intercourse more freely with the
converts than with others. <i>Hist. Verdad.</i>, 175.
</p>

<p class='footnote' id='FN_XXV-5'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XXV-5'>[XXV-5]</a></span> Patinamit, or Iximché, called by Alvarado the city of Guatemala.
Juarros is in doubt as to the site of the ancient Cakchiquel capital. Remesal
makes no mention of it, though he speaks of the founding of the Villa de
Guatemala. Fuentes argues that it was not Patinamit, but a city on the
slope of the Volcan de Agua, occupying the same position that San Miguel
Tzacualpa occupied when he wrote. His reasons are, first, the preservation
of the Indian name Guatemala, indicating that the Spaniards did not
found a new town, but occupied the existing city; the custom of the Spaniards
being to give Spanish names to cities founded by them, as Trujillo,
Granada, Cartago, and others, while those cities which were already founded
retained their native names, as Mexico, Cuzco, Tlascala, and the like. Again,
as observed elsewhere, the word Guatemala is derived from <i>Coctecmalan</i>,
which means <i>Palo de leche</i>, milk-tree, commonly called <i>Yerba mala</i>. This
is found only at Antigua Guatemala, and within a league around, in which
space, therefore, the capital must have stood. But it was not situated
where Antigua Guatemala stands, because that place was always called <i>Panchoy</i>,
or Great Lagoon; nor where the Pueblo of Ciudad Vieja stands, which
locality was called <i>Atmulunca</i>, meaning Gushing Water. Therefore it must
have been on the spot where stood the city of the Spaniards, which was
destroyed in 1541, and where now exists the little village of Tzacualpa, which
name in itself is an additional argument in favor of this supposition, inasmuch
as its meaning is Old Town. The third argument of Fuentes is based on the
improbability that the Spaniards would found a city in an unpopulated district
when the court and capital of the Cakchiquels were at their command.
Consequently the court of King Sinacam was situated where the Spaniards
first established themselves, that is where Tzacualpa stands. See also <i>Juarros</i>,
<i>Guat.</i>, ii. 255-9. Vazquez maintains that this capital was the city Patinamit,
antonomastically so called, meaning the 'metropolis' or 'the city' par excellence.
The locality on which it was built was called 'Iximché,' and in his
own time Ohertinamit, which means Old Town. The Mexicans who came
with the Spaniards called it Quauhtemali, meaning rotten tree, from an old
worm-eaten Iximché tree. To distinguish it from the Ciudad de Santiago
founded by the Spaniards, it was afterward named Tecpan Guatemala, that
is, Palace or Royal House of Guatemala, a meaning different from that given
by Fuentes, who says that Tecpan means 'above,' <i>encima</i>, as Tecpan Atitlan,
a town situated on a more elevated site than Atitlan. The city Tecpan
Guatemala still exists about half a league distant from the old site. Vazquez,
moreover, supports his opinion on the extent and magnificence of the palace
and public buildings indicated by the ruins, which he visited in person; and
also on the fortified position of the place. <i>Chronica de Gvat.</i>, 7, 10, 68, 73;
<i>Juarros</i>, <i>Guat.</i>, ii. 243, 256-7. That the arguments of Fuentes are fallacious,
and that Vazquez is right, Alvarado's own despatches prove almost to a certainty.
In his report to Cortés, dated 11th April, at Utatlan, he says, 'Embiè à
la Ciudad de Guatemala, que està diez Leguas de esta,' and afterward informs
Cortés that on that day he will leave for the city of Guatemala, 'Yo me parto
para la Ciudad de Guatemala Lunes once de Abril.' At the commencement
of the next despatch he writes, 'Yo, Señor, partì de la Ciudad de Uclatan, í
vine en dos Dias à esta Ciudad de Guatemala.' Now this 'city of Guatemala'
was the capital of the king of the Cakchiquels, and where Alvarado was entertained
by him, as will be told in the text, and it was ten leagues from
Utatlan, a distance which would occupy the army two days, as stated by
Alvarado; for it was difficult ground to march over, being intersected by
numerous ravines. <i>Vazquez</i>, <i>Chronica de Gvat.</i>, 7. The site proposed by
Fuentes is nearly twice the distance from Utatlan, and could not have been
reached by the Spaniards in the short period of two days, except by very exhausting
and forced marches, to which it is most improbable that Alvarado
subjected his men when on a visit to a friendly power. Again, Alvarado
reports that when on his expedition against Atitlan he left the city of Guatemala
and by a forced march entered that territory the same day—'I anduve
tanto, que aquel Dia lleguè a su Tierra'—a distance that could be accomplished
from the existing ruins of Patinamit, but apparently not from the
Volcan de Agua.

of whom twenty were cross-bowmen and arquebusiers, and 40 horsemen, with
2000 Guatemalans. It must, however, be concluded that the statements of
the 'true historian' with regard to the conquest of Guatemala cannot be relied
on as exact, since he admits that he was not present: 'Y esto digo, porque no
me halle en estas Conquistas.' <i>Hist. Verdad.</i>, 175-6. Brasseur de Bourbourg
also states that 2000 Cakchiquels, commanded by the Ahpotzotzil and
the Ahpoxahil, accompanied the Spaniards. <i>Hist. Nat. Civ.</i>, iv. 652. Juarros
gives the forces as consisting of 40 horse, 100 foot, and 2000 Guatemalans. It
is quite evident that this author never consulted Alvarado's despatches, judging
from the many instances of chronological, numerical, and other differences.
Alvarado says he marched so rapidly that he reached the territory of the
Zutugils the same day on which he left the city of Guatemala. Juarros writes,

and dated February 1, 1571, it is stated that when Alvarado came into the
country he was received in a friendly spirit at Atitlan; that no one took up
arms against him, but that valuable presents were made, while each town
and village paid tribute according to its means. Numbers of their principal
men accompanied him on his future campaigns, and lost their lives
in his service. <i>Ternaux-Compans</i>, <i>Voy.</i>, série i., tom. x., 419-20. Though
the Atitlan campaign was less sanguinary than the previous ones, this contradiction
of all accounts, in stating that the Spaniards were peaceably received,
must have proceeded from anxiety on the part of the natives to gain some favor
or obtain some redress.

was one of the wives of the monarch. <i>Ramirez</i>, <i>Proceso contra Alvarado</i>, 7,

<p class='footnote' id='FN_XXV-22'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XXV-22'>[XXV-22]</a></span> The defence set up by Alvarado when charged with this outrage is
exceedingly weak. He had been deceived by the Cakchiquel nobles, he said,
who, not wishing him to march farther south, made false representations
regarding the difficulties he would meet with. A Spanish soldier named
Falcon reported that a slave girl described the country as fair and rich; upon
which Alvarado commanded her to be brought forward. This was persistently
refused by the chiefs, until he seized one; then an Indian girl of noble birth
was produced, but not the right one. 'He, however, importuned them much,'
and finally Suchil was delivered up to him. The reader will appreciate the
probability of this story when he considers how likely it was that the Cakchiquel
nobles would seek to deter Alvarado from proceeding against their
national enemies. <i>Ramirez</i>, <i>Proceso contra Alvarado</i>. See question and charge,

a little later in this campaign states that he had 150 infantry, 100 horse,
and 5000 or 6000 Indian auxiliaries. This number of infantry is more probably
correct than that given by Juarros. Alvarado had only 300 infantry
when he left Mexico, and, though few had been killed, numbers were
wounded, and he had left garrisons at various places. <i>Relacion</i>, i. 163. That
he should leave Itzcuintlan with 250 Spanish foot-soldiers and lose 100 of them

Juarros differs so much from Alvarado's that I can give the former but little
consideration in the text. It is to this effect: After crossing the river the
Spaniards were attacked by a large body of Indians, and an obstinate battle
ensued, in which Alvarado was dismounted by a chief, who wounded his
horse with a lance. Alvarado then attacked the Indian on foot and killed
him. The victory was for some time doubtful, but passed finally to the
Spaniards. On the following day they entered the deserted town, where
before long they were again attacked by a fresh body of the enemy. Cooped
in the narrow streets, the Spaniards could not act, and retreated to open
ground, where they soon threw the Indians into disorder.</p>

<p class="footnote">
Alvarado's despatches to Cortés, <i>Relacion de Alvarado</i>, form the base of
that portion of the conquest of Guatemala which begins with the departure
of the Spaniards from Soconusco and terminates with the founding of the
Ciudad de Santiago at Patinamit. Two only of these reports are extant; that
there was at least one more is certain from the opening line of the first,
wherein Alvarado states that he had written from Soconusco; 'de Soncomisco
escrivì à Vuestra Magestad.' It might be supposed, from the expression
'Vuestra Magestad,' that the letter was addressed to the king of Spain; the
conclusion, however, proves that such was not the case, as Alvarado requests
Cortés to report his services to his Majesty. 'Magestad' is probably a misprint
for 'Merced,' or an incorrect reading of the manuscript. These despatches
were first published at Toledo, October 20, 1525, with the fourth
report of Cortés to the king of Spain. They were afterward translated into
Italian by Ramusio and published at Venice in 1565. In 1749 Barcia, a
member of the royal council, reproduced them, in Madrid, in his collection
of the works of the chroniclers, and it may be remarked that Ramusio's
translation does not always agree with this Spanish edition. Ternaux-Compans
translated Ramusio's version into French and published the letters
at Paris, in 1838, in his Collection of Voyages. Alvarado's style is
clear and simple, terse and vigorous, and his descriptions are vivid. That
he did not report all his proceedings to Cortés is evident from the <i>Proceso
contra Alvarado</i>, already frequently quoted, in which numerous acts of
cruelty, outrage, and embezzlement are charged against him. Yet there
is no just reason to doubt the truthfulness of his narrations so far as they
go, since they are supported by good authorities. It is suppression and
not misrepresentation of facts that can be charged against him. In these
two despatches the writer has portrayed his own character most clearly.
His energy, recklessness, and indomitable will, his bravery, religious superstition,
and ambition, are all distinctly displayed; but in bold relief,
prominent above all other traits, is recognized his cruelty: whenever the
carnage on the battle-field has been unusually dreadful he delights to report
it to Cortés, sometimes even mentioning the matter twice; and when the
natives have managed to escape him with comparatively small loss, he
regretfully enters into explanations and gives the reasons why so few lives
were taken. These despatches are particularly interesting for their evidence
relative to the site of the first city founded by the Spaniards in
Guatemala. They moreover correct many errors committed by Remesal,
Fuentes, and Juarros, who, strange to say, could never have seen these reports,
or even Oviedo's almost verbatim copy of them. Another narrative of the
conquest was written by Gonzalo de Alvarado, which work Pelaez, <i>Mem.
Guat.</i>, i. 47, considers that Herrera must have seen. It was never published;
Juarros thus describes it: 'MS. de Gonzalo de Alvarado, que paraba en poder
de D. Nicolas de Vides y Alvarado, su descendiente.'

<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XXVII-2'>[XXVII-2]</a></span> Vazquez observes, 'Llegó â <i>Vulvusya</i> que oy llaman Almolonga; y auiendo
en la falda de su bolcan assentado el Real a los 25 de Jullio de 1524, diò su
primer ser a la Ciudad de Guatemala, con Nõbre de Villa que le duró muy
pocos dias.' <i>Chronica de Gvat.</i>, 7. Remesal also states that the city was
founded on the slopes of the Volcan de Agua, at a place called Panchoy,
which signifies Great Lagoon, the valley there being surrounded by mountains.
The material of which the first houses were built consisted, he says, of
forked posts for the corner pillars, of canes and mud for the walls, while the
roofs were thatched with dry grass. By the aid of the Mexicans they were
rapidly thrown up. A sufficient number for the accommodation of all the army
being completed, they waited for the day of the Apostle Santiago, in order to
found the city on that day and dedicate it to their patron saint. It fell on
Monday, the 25th of July, when the founding was consummated. <i>Remesal</i>,
<i>Hist. Chyapa</i>, 4. I have elsewhere shown that Patinamit was the city which
Alvarado called Guatemala. Now there is positive evidence from his own
despatch that he founded the city of Santiago at or upon that same city of
Guatemala. 'Antes acorde me bolver à esta Ciudad de Guatemala, ... asi que
Yo soi venido à esta Ciudad ... hice, i edifiquè, en nombre de su Magestad, vna
Ciudad de Españoles, que se dice la Ciudad del Señor Santiago,' he writes.
The use of the expression 'esta Ciudad de Guatemala' in other portions of the
despatch proves that it was written at the capital of the Cakchiquel king,
while at the conclusion it is dated thus: 'De esta ciudad de Santiago, à veinte
i ocho de Julio de mil i quinientos i veinte i quatro Años.' Thus it is clear
that the city of Guatemala and the city of Santiago were one, and that Alvarado
appropriated to himself Sinacam's capital. <i>Alvarado</i>, <i>Relacion</i>, i. 161-2,
165-6. It may be here stated that in direct opposition to Alvarado's application
of the term ciudad to the new settlement, both Vazquez and Remesal
assert that it was a villa, the latter adding that it retained this title eighteen
days, and was erected into a city on the 12th of August. <i>Remesal</i>, <i>Hist.
Chyapa</i>, 4, 6. Pelaez says the city was called 'Ciudad de Santiago de los
caballeros,' but not till November 22, 1527. Vazquez affirms, <i>Chronica de
Gvat.</i>, 11, that it was so called on the 29th of July, 1524, while Remesal gives
August 12th of the same year. Pelaez, in his introduction to vol. i., states that
Guatemala took its name from the expression of Guhatezmalhá, that is
to say 'the hill which throws out water.' From the acts of the cabildo we
know that it was called a city on the 29th of July, 1524. <i>Arévalo</i>, <i>Actas

<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XXVII-5'>[XXVII-5]</a></span> The cabildo, as an assumption of its official prerogatives, entered into
session the same day, and arranged legal prices for provisions. <i>Remesal</i>, <i>Hist.
Chyapa</i>, 4. On July 27th we find that an act was passed regulating the blacksmith's
rates. Two dollars was to be his charge for making 100 nails, the
iron being furnished to him. The charge for shoeing a horse one gold dollar,
and the same for bleeding. It is curious to observe that the price of horseshoes
in Alvarado's army in April, 1524, was $190 a dozen, at which rate
they were bought and sold in his camp. <i>Alvarado</i>, <i>Relacion</i>, i. 160. Remesal
says that operatives, knowing the necessity of their services, charged what
they liked. The tailor charged a real a stitch, and shoemakers worked only
at such high wages that while soling other people's shoes with leather they
might have used silver for their own; and the blacksmith could have made
his tools of gold had he wished. On the 12th of December, 1524, the cabildo
deemed it necessary to establish fixed rates for labor of all kinds. The
measures adopted were punctually carried out by those in power. The regulations
were modified as time required, and every two years, at most,
new rates were adapted to the condition of affairs, with which even the lords
of estates were compelled to comply. The artisans, however, still contrived
to cause the other colonists much inconvenience by refusing all payment for
work except in gold coin, the tailor otherwise retaining his customer's clothes,
even on a feast-day, and the shoemaker his shoes. This state of things
lasted till 1529, when the corporation on the 19th of February made the
aboriginal currency of the country, cacao, feathers, and clothing, legal tender.
<i>Hist. Chyapa</i>, 6;
<i>Arévalo</i>, <i>Actas Ayunt. Guat.</i>, 8-67, passim. Another of the
first acts of this new corporation was the appointment of a town-crier, his
salary being fixed at $100 a year. <i>Id.</i>, 7-8. With regard to this office of
crier, Remesal states that it had to be accepted by the person selected to fill
it under pain of death. <i>Hist. Chyapa</i>, 4. On the present occasion the person
chosen was Diego Diaz, who strongly objected to the calling, but was compelled
to accept. Remesal, with his death penalty, goes beyond the act of
the corporation, which says 'so pena de cient azotes.' <i>Arévalo</i>, <i>Actas Ayunt.

<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XXVII-17'>[XXVII-17]</a></span> Brasseur de Bourbourg takes the view that both the later Zacatepec
war and the capture of Mixco occurred during the suppression of the Cakchiquel
revolt. But he seems to me somewhat inconsistent. He makes the
subjugation of the Cakchiquels last 'pendant plusieurs mois' after Alvarado's
return to Patinamit, and yet a little later he points out that during the
first months of the year 1525 Salvador was reconquered and a Spanish town
founded there. <i>Hist. Nat. Civ.</i>, iv. 680-1. It is scarcely to be supposed that
a second campaign into Salvador could have been undertaken while the Cakchiquel
war was going on. Moreover, according to his interpretation of the
Cakchiquel manuscript, the town of Zumpango was one of many which submitted
to the Spaniards after the destruction of Mixco; and, as will be seen
later, the reduction of Zacatepec was owing to the hostile incursions from
that district against Zumpango while Alvarado was absent on a campaign.
The Cakchiquel manuscript is the production of Francisco Ernandez Arana
Xahila, and contains a brief history of the Cakchiquel nation from the earliest
times. The author was the grandson of King Hunyg of the Ahpotzotzil line,
and it is written in his hand down to the year 1562, from which time it is
continued somewhat further by Francisco Gebuta Queh, of the same family.

It was situated in the valley of Xilotepec, on a ridge between the Pixcayatl
and the Rio Grande de Motagua, the former river being a tributary of the
latter, and meaning 'guardian stream.' <i>Juarros</i>, <i>Guat.</i>, ii. 350;

more than 200 Chignautecs fell, says Juarros. On the side of the Spaniards
many Tlascaltecs were slain, among whom were two illustrious chiefs, Juan
Xuchiatl and Gerónimo Carrillo—the Spanish name of this Indian chief—while
of the Spaniards themselves a considerable proportion received severe
wounds. <i>Guat.</i>, ii. 285. Besides Aguilar and the three captains, whose
names are given in the text, Fuentes mentions also Gutierre de Robles
and Pedro de Olmos as having greatly signalized themselves in this action.

<p class='footnote' id='FN_XXVII-23'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XXVII-23'>[XXVII-23]</a></span> Fuentes, who wrote between 1690 and 1700, gives a partial description
of a cavern, the entrance to which was on a small ridge by the side of the
ruins of Mixco. The door-way was of clay, three feet wide and three high.
Thirty-six stone steps led down to a spacious chamber, having at its end
another flight of stairs, down which no one had passed far, for the reason
that the ground began to tremble as the explorer proceeded. Eighteen steps
had, however, been descended, and an arched opening on the right side discovered,
leading by six steps into a long cavern. No further explorations
had been made. Ubi sup., cap. ii.;
<i>Juarros</i>, <i>Guat.</i>, ii. 350-1 <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/44104/44104-h/44104-h.htm#Page_119"><i>Native Races</i>, iv.

</p>

<p class='footnote' id='FN_XXVII-24'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XXVII-24'>[XXVII-24]</a></span> The distance of the outlet from the camp must have been considerable,
as Fuentes states that a day was allowed for the arrival of Loarca's force at
the cave. <i>Fuentes y Guzman</i>, <i>Recordacion Florida</i>, MS., 17.
</p>

<p class='footnote' id='FN_XXVII-25'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XXVII-25'>[XXVII-25]</a></span> The account given by Fuentes is somewhat confused. From his version
on page 17 the reader is led to suppose that Loarca's party were to ascend by
the cavernous passage, and in the order given in the text, while on page 19 he
states that those who fled by the cave were attacked by the party 'stationed
in ambush.'
</p>

<p class='footnote' id='FN_XXVII-26'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XXVII-26'>[XXVII-26]</a></span> Fuentes says that Lopez de Villanueva and two others quickly took his

<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XXVII-28'>[XXVII-28]</a></span> The Mixco of to-day is distant from the present city of Guatemala about
two leagues, and nine or ten leagues from the ruins of the Mixco destroyed
by Alvarado. Its destruction was followed by the submission of various
towns, among which, according to the Cakchiquel MS., were Xilotepec, Yampuk,
Papuluka, and Zumpango.

<i>Juarros</i>, <i>Guat.</i>, ii. 281;
<i>Fuentes y Guzman</i>, <i>Recordacion

Fuentes, stating that 'this is false, because they had rebelled previous to
the arrival of the Spaniards and made their capital at Yampuk.' <i>Fuentes y
Guzman</i>, <i>Recordacion Florida</i>, MS., 12-3.
</p>

<p class='footnote' id='FN_XXVII-30'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XXVII-30'>[XXVII-30]</a></span> Fuentes asserts that they were wont to celebrate their feasts, during
which these victims were immolated, on hills in full view of the Indians who
were friendly to the Spaniards, in order to provoke them.
</p>

<p class='footnote' id='FN_XXVII-31'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XXVII-31'>[XXVII-31]</a></span> Juarros assigns too early a date, January 1525, for the events which
follow, but he appears to be quite unconscious of this first Cakchiquel revolt.
<i>Guat.</i>, ii. 281. Jimenez has made a marginal note in the manuscript
of Fuentes as follows: 'This town,' meaning Xinaco, 'was founded some time
afterward—therefore this is false.'
</p>

<p class='footnote' id='FN_XXVII-32'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XXVII-32'>[XXVII-32]</a></span> Fuentes states that the Spaniards at this time were engaged in the
Atitlan war. <i>Recordacion Florida</i>, MS., 13. This is a mistake. Atitlan was
subdued in 1524, and Alvarado, who gives a detailed account of the affair,
would have mentioned this war with the Zacatepecs had it occurred at that
time. Juarros says Alvarado was engaged in the Atitlan war or that of the
Pipiles. <i>Guat.</i>, ii. 282. This latter conjecture is doubtless right. There
is evidence that Alvarado undertook his second campaign along the coast
against Salvador during the early part of 1525, conquered the country, and
founded the city of San Salvador. No records of the events remain, but from
an act of the cabildo of Guatemala, dated the 6th of May, 1525, we learn that
one Diego Holguin had previously left the city to 'reside in the villa de San
Salvador, of which he was alcalde.' <i>Arévalo</i>, <i>Actas Ayunt. Guat.</i>, 13.
</p>

<p class='footnote' id='FN_XXVII-33'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XXVII-33'>[XXVII-33]</a></span> Fuentes, followed by Juarros, states that this was done by the advice of
an aged Indian named Choboloc. He had observed that the Spaniards did
not engage with all their forces at once, but always kept a body of men in
reserve, and suggested to the chiefs of his nation the adoption of similar
tactics.

<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XXVII-35'>[XXVII-35]</a></span> This ruler, says Gonzalo de Alvarado, displayed in his person the
nobility of his blood and was about 40 years of age. <i>Alvarado, Gonzalo de</i>,

</p>

<p class='footnote' id='FN_XXVII-36'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XXVII-36'>[XXVII-36]</a></span> The Cakchiquels are said to have applied the word Mem to the Maya-speaking
tribes. This word, meaning 'stutterers,' was corrupted by the Spaniards
into Mames. They occupied that portion of the country which lay
between the Quiché territory and Chiapas, now the province of Totonicapan.

<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XXVII-37'>[XXVII-37]</a></span> The Hondo, during the dry season, is but a small shallow stream. In
the wet season, however, it becomes a deep and dangerous river, hence its
name, El Rio Hondo, 'the deep river.'

<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XXVII-40'>[XXVII-40]</a></span> Like Utatlan and Mixco, this city was situated on a plateau surrounded
by ravines. The plateau was twelve miles in circumference, and on it are still
to be seen the ruins of Zakuléu, known by the name of Las Cuevas, the caves,
about half a league from Huehuetenango. They are only a confused heap of
rubbish, overgrown with brushwood. Two pyramidal structures of stone and
mortar can, however, be made out. Juarros calls the place Socoleo, which is
the present name of a village and stream in the locality. <i>Guat.</i>, ii. 313-14;

while eight soldiers were severely wounded, among them Gonzalo de Alvarado.

medals. <i>Alvarado, Gonzalo de</i>, <i>Memoria</i>, MS.;

<p class='footnote' id='FN_XXVII-44'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XXVII-44'>[XXVII-44]</a></span> During the battle, which was fought in full view of Zakuléu, the Mames
attempted a sally in support of the mountaineers but were repelled by Salazar.
<i>Juarros</i>, <i>Guat.</i>, ii. 317.
</p>

<p class='footnote' id='FN_XXVII-45'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XXVII-45'>[XXVII-45]</a></span> Juarros adds that Gonzalo did not adopt this plan at first for the reason
that he wanted to avail himself of his cavalry in the assault. <i>Guat.</i>, ii. 318.
</p>

<p class='footnote' id='FN_XXVII-47'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XXVII-47'>[XXVII-47]</a></span> Juarros states that a stone slab formed the door of the fort, and that this
was broken up.

<p class='footnote' id='FN_XXVII-48'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XXVII-48'>[XXVII-48]</a></span> The authorities that have been consulted for the history of the conquest
of Guatemala are the following: <i>Cortés</i>, <i>Cartas</i> [ed. Paris, 1866], 289-90, 304-5,
containing information down to the departure of Alvarado for Guatemala;
<i>Alvarado</i>, <i>Relacion</i>, in <i>Barcia</i>, <i>Hist. Prim.</i>, 157-66, and in <i>Ternaux-Compans</i>,
<i>Voy.</i>, série i., tom. x., 107-50, taken as bases of that portion of the history
which includes the entrance into Guatemala territory and succeeding events
down to the founding of the city of Santiago;
<i>Oviedo</i>, iii. 448, 459-60, 475-87,
wherein Cortés and Alvarado are closely followed;
<i>Peter Martyr</i>, dec. viii.
cap. v., relating mainly to the narrative of the messengers sent to Guatemala,
merely mentioning Alvarado's departure;
<i>Gomara</i>, <i>Hist. Mex.</i>, 229-33;
<i>Id.</i>, <i>Hist. Ind.</i>, 266-8, which affords but little additional information to
that supplied by Oviedo;
<i>Chimalpain</i>, <i>Hist. Conq.</i>, ii. 100-5, 181-2;
<i>Bernal
Diaz</i>, <i>Hist. Verdad.</i>, 77, 174-6;
<i>Las Casas</i>, <i>Regio. Ind. Devastat.</i>, 35-40, and
<i>Ixtlilxochitl</i>, <i>Horribles Crueldades</i>, 66-71. The former of these two last authorities
is exceptionally severe against Alvarado, and enumerates numbers of
atrocities committed by him and his followers, while the latter prominently
brings forward the services of the Mexican auxiliaries, and mentions the excessive
hardships and cruelties they suffered. <i>Id.</i>, <i>Relaciones</i>, 431-3. Herrera,
dec. iii. lib. v. cap. viii.-xi., occasionally differs from Alvarado's statements,
but is generally reliable. See also <i>Lorenzana</i>, <i>Viage</i>, in <i>Cortés</i>, <i>Hist. N.
España</i>, 335-6, 369-70;
<i>Pacheco</i> and <i>Cárdenas</i>, <i>Col. Doc.</i>, viii. 17;
<i>Arévalo</i>,
<i>Actas Ayunt. Guat.</i>, 7-15;
<i>Ramirez</i>, <i>Proceso contra Alvarado</i>, passim—which
work throws much light upon the doings of the conqueror, though contradictory
evidence renders it ofttimes difficult to decide on the merits of a charge;
<i>Ramusio</i>, <i>Viaggi</i>, iii. 296-8;
<i>Atitlan</i>, <i>Requête de plusieurs chefs</i>, in <i>Ternaux-Compans</i>,
série i., tom. x., 415-25;
<i>Suchimilco</i>, <i>Carta de sus caciques</i>, in <i>Pacheco</i>
and <i>Cárdenas</i>, <i>Col. Doc.</i>, xii., 293-4;
<i>Remesal</i>, <i>Hist. Chyapa</i>, 2-7, an author
unreliable so far as the conquest of Guatemala goes when not supported by
other authorities;

<i>Voyages, Selection of Curious,
Rare, and Early</i>, 31;
<i>Fuentes y Guzman</i>, <i>Recordacion Florida</i>, MS., 1-4,
12-19, 25-7, has many errors and is far from reliable;

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
